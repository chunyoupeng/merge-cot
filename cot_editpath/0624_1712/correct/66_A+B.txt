### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> final <newline> <newline> Objects . requireNonNull ( tabletsKeyValues ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the keyword `final` to the parameter `SortedMap<Key,Value> tabletsKeyValues` and added a line `Objects.requireNonNull(tabletsKeyValues);` to enforce a null check.
   - **Branch `b`** made minimal changes, adding and deleting newlines, which are likely formatting adjustments. It does not introduce any functional changes.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The addition of `final` in `a` is a defensive programming practice to prevent reassignment of the parameter, which can help avoid bugs.
   - The `Objects.requireNonNull(tabletsKeyValues);` line in `a` is a clear and explicit null check, which improves robustness and helps catch invalid inputs early.
   - The changes in `b` are purely cosmetic and do not affect the logic or correctness of the method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve code safety and clarity by making the parameter `final` and adding a null check.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to reformat the method for readability, but the changes are minimal and do not conflict with the logic in `a`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `a` are functional and improve the correctness and robustness of the method.
   - The changes in `b` are non-conflicting and can be safely incorporated as formatting adjustments.
   - The resolution should include the `final` keyword and the null check from `a`, while preserving the formatting style of `b` where possible.

      KeyExtent extent, TServerInstance instance, final SortedMap<Key,Value> tabletsKeyValues,
