### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
return new StringMetricBuilder().with(new OverlapCoefficient<String>())
				.tokenize(new WhitespaceTokenizer()).build();
||||||| base
return new StringMetricBuilder().with(new OverlapCoefficient<String>())
				.tokenize(new WhitespaceTokenizer())
				.build();
=======
return with(new OverlapCoefficient<String>())
				.tokenize(new WhitespaceTokenizer())
				.build();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline>


## From base to b
<DELETE> new StringMetricBuilder ( ) .


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the newline after the `WhitespaceTokenizer()` call. This is a minor formatting change and does not affect the logic.
   - **Branch `b`** removed the `new StringMetricBuilder().` part and instead used a method reference or a static method, likely assuming that `with` is a static method or a method on a default instance.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is purely stylistic and does not affect the behavior of the code. It's a formatting adjustment.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is more significant. It removes the explicit instantiation of `StringMetricBuilder`, which implies that the `with` method is either a static method or is being called on a default instance. This could be a refactoring to reduce boilerplate or improve readability.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to clean up the formatting of the code.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to simplify the code by removing unnecessary object instantiation, possibly to make the code more concise or to align with a new API design.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since **branch `b`**'s change is more substantial and likely reflects a design or API change, it should be prioritized.
   - The formatting change from **branch `a`** can be applied on top of `b`'s change to maintain consistent formatting.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should adopt the logic from `b` and apply the formatting from `a`.
