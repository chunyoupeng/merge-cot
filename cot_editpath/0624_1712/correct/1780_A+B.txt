### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which added new code to a previously empty base.
   - Branch `a` added a `PollingStrategyConfig` constant with a `FETCH` type, a 0.5 value, and a reference to `UPPER_LIMIT_FRACTION_OF_THREADS_FOR_FETCH`.
   - Branch `b` added two constants related to logging: `DEFAULT_FAILURE_LOG_LEVEL` and `LOG_STACK_TRACE_ON_FAILURE`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The changes in `a` and `b` are unrelated. `a` is focused on defining a default polling strategy, while `b` is focused on defining logging behavior for failures.
   - Neither change appears to interfere with the other. They are adding separate constants to the same file, which is acceptable in Java as long as the constants are logically grouped or the file is designed to hold multiple configuration constants.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to configure a default polling strategy for a system, likely to control how often or under what conditions data is fetched.
   - The intention of `b` is to configure logging behavior for failure scenarios, ensuring that failures are logged at a specific level and optionally include stack traces.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and do not conflict in terms of code structure or logic, the best resolution is to merge both changes into the final file.
   - The order of the constants may be adjusted for clarity or logical grouping, but this is a matter of style and not correctness.
