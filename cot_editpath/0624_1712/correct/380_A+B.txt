### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (configuration.isAllowHighlighting()) {
||||||| base
if (server.getConfiguration().isAllowHighlighting()) {
=======
if (highlight && server.getConfiguration().isAllowHighlighting()) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> server <WITH> configuration)
<DELETE> . getConfiguration ( )


## From base to b
<ADD> highlight & &


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the **base**, the condition is: `if (server.getConfiguration().isAllowHighlighting()) {`
   - In **a**, the condition is: `if (configuration.isAllowHighlighting()) {`
     - This change replaces `server.getConfiguration()` with a direct `configuration` variable.
     - It removes the call to `getConfiguration()` and assumes `configuration` is already available.
   - In **b**, the condition is: `if (highlight && server.getConfiguration().isAllowHighlighting()) {`
     - This adds a new condition `highlight &&` before the existing `server.getConfiguration().isAllowHighlighting()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in a:** It simplifies the code by removing the nested method call and using a local variable `configuration`. This could be for performance or readability, assuming `configuration` is already accessible.
   - **Change in b:** It introduces a new condition `highlight` that must be true for the block to execute. This suggests a new requirement or feature that depends on both highlighting being enabled and the configuration allowing it.

3. **Understand the intention:**
   - **a's intention:** To streamline the code by using a pre-resolved configuration object, likely for efficiency or clarity.
   - **b's intention:** To add a new conditional requirement (`highlight`) that must be satisfied in addition to the configuration allowing highlighting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best resolution is to **combine both changes**:
     - Use the simplified `configuration` from **a**.
     - Add the `highlight &&` condition from **b**.
   - This results in: `if (highlight && configuration.isAllowHighlighting()) {`
   - This maintains the performance/readability improvement from **a** and incorporates the new logic from **b**.

if (highlight && configuration.isAllowHighlighting()) {
