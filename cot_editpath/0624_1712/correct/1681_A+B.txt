### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

assertThat(sdkPicker.selectSdks(buildConfig(new Config.Builder().setMinSdk(21)), usesSdk))

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ( buildConfig
<DELETE> . build (


## From base to b
<REPLACE> sdkProvider <WITH> sdkCollection)
<REPLACE> sdkProvider <WITH> sdkCollection)
<REPLACE> sdkProvider <WITH> sdkCollection)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the expression `new Config.Builder().setMinSdk(21).build()` with `buildConfig(new Config.Builder().setMinSdk(21))`.
     - This suggests that `a` introduced a new method `buildConfig` to encapsulate the configuration building logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced all instances of `sdkProvider` with `sdkCollection`.
     - This indicates a refactoring where `sdkProvider` is being replaced with a new variable or class `sdkCollection`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`**:
     - The use of `buildConfig(...)` is likely an abstraction to make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
     - It is a logical change if the intention is to encapsulate the configuration building process.
   - **Change in `b`**:
     - Replacing `sdkProvider` with `sdkCollection` is a significant refactoring.
     - It implies that `sdkCollection` is now the source of SDKs instead of `sdkProvider`.
     - This change is likely part of a broader effort to rename or restructure the SDK management logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Intends to improve code readability and modularity by abstracting the configuration building logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Intends to refactor the SDK management logic, possibly to use a more descriptive or appropriate name (`sdkCollection`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes.
   - The abstraction introduced in `a` (`buildConfig(...)`) should be retained for better code structure.
   - The refactoring in `b` (`sdkProvider` â†’ `sdkCollection`) should also be retained since it reflects a consistent naming change.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both changes: use `buildConfig(...)` and replace `sdkProvider` with `sdkCollection`.

        .containsExactly(sdkCollection.getSdk(21), sdkCollection.getSdk(22),
