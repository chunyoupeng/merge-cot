### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private boolean copyMap(final MapModel map, final String pDirectoryName) throws IOException {
		final boolean success = true;
||||||| base
private boolean copyMap(MapModel map, final String pDirectoryName) throws IOException {
		final boolean success = true;
=======
private boolean copyMap(MapModel map, final String pDirectoryName){
		boolean success = true;
		try {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> final


## From base to b
<DELETE> throws IOException final
<ADD> <newline> try {


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** added the keyword `final` to the method parameter `map`.
   - **Branch b** removed `throws IOException` from the method signature and added a `try` block at the start of the method body.
   - The conflict occurs because both branches modified the method signature and the method body in ways that are incompatible when merged.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change (`final`):** Adding `final` to the parameter `map` is a stylistic and defensive programming choice. It prevents the parameter from being reassigned within the method, which can help avoid bugs and improve code clarity.
   - **Branch b's change (`throws IOException` removed and `try` added):** This change suggests that the exception handling is now being done internally within the method instead of being declared in the method signature. This is a logical shift in error handling strategy, possibly to encapsulate the exception handling within the method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To improve code safety and clarity by making the parameter `final`.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To encapsulate exception handling within the method, likely to make the method easier to use by not requiring the caller to handle `IOException`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `final` keyword from branch a is a non-intrusive and beneficial addition that should be retained.
   - The removal of `throws IOException` and the addition of a `try` block from branch b is a more significant change that reflects a shift in error handling strategy. This should also be retained, as it aligns with modern practices of encapsulating exception handling.
   - The resolution should combine both changes: retain the `final` keyword for the parameter and remove `throws IOException` from the method signature while adding a `try` block at the start of the method body.
