### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> OneDriveFindFeature <WITH> GraphFindFeature)
<REPLACE> OneDriveFindFeature <WITH> GraphFindFeature)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> TestSessionPool <WITH> SessionPool)
<ADD> . SingleSessionPool , new DisabledListProgressListener ( ) , new DisabledListProgressListener ( )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `OneDriveFindFeature` with `GraphFindFeature` in both `assertTrue` lines.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Replaced `TestSessionPool` with `SessionPool.SingleSessionPool`.
     - Added `new DisabledListProgressListener()` as an argument to the `find` method in both `assertTrue` lines.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:**
     - Replacing `OneDriveFindFeature` with `GraphFindFeature` suggests a switch in the implementation of the find feature, possibly to support a different backend or API (e.g., Graph API instead of OneDrive API).
     - This change is likely intentional and significant for the logic of the test.
   - **Change in `b`:**
     - Replacing `TestSessionPool` with `SessionPool.SingleSessionPool` suggests a refactoring or optimization of session management.
     - Adding `new DisabledListProgressListener()` to the `find` method indicates that the method now accepts a progress listener as an argument, and the test is being updated to reflect this change in the API.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To update the test to use the `GraphFindFeature` instead of `OneDriveFindFeature`, likely to align with a new or updated feature implementation.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To refactor the session pool usage and update the test to match a new API signature of the `find` method that now includes a progress listener.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and should be preserved.
   - The `GraphFindFeature` from `a` should be used instead of `OneDriveFindFeature`.
   - The `SessionPool.SingleSessionPool` from `b` should replace `TestSessionPool`.
   - The `new DisabledListProgressListener()` from `b` should be added to the `find` method calls.
   - The result is a test that uses the updated session pool, the new find feature, and the new API with the progress listener.

        assertTrue(new CryptoFindFeature(session, new GraphFindFeature(session), cryptomator).find(file, new DisabledListProgressListener()));
        assertTrue(new CryptoFindFeature(session, new GraphFindFeature(session), cryptomator).find(fileRenamed, new DisabledListProgressListener()));
