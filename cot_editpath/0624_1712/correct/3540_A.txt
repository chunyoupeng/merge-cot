You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in a `switch` statement that maps `Email.TYPE_*` constants to string representations.
   - Comparing `base`, `a`, and `b`, there are no functional differences in the code. All three versions have the same logic and structure.
   - The only difference is **whitespace and indentation**:
     - In `base`, the code has extra spaces after the colon in each `case` line.
     - In `a`, the code is slightly more compact (no extra spaces after the colon).
     - In `b`, the code is also compact and matches `a` in formatting.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The changes in `a` and `b` are purely stylistic and do not affect the behavior of the code.
   - The `base` version has a slightly less consistent indentation style (extra spaces after the colon).
   - Since both `a` and `b` have the same formatting and no functional changes, the conflict is not about logic but about code style.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` and `b` appears to be to clean up the formatting by removing unnecessary whitespace.
   - The intention of `base` is unclear, but it likely reflects an older or less consistent style.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` have the same formatting and no functional differences, the resolution should preserve the consistent formatting.
   - The most logical resolution is to adopt the formatting from either `a` or `b`, as they are identical in this context.
   - We will choose the formatting from `a` or `b` as it is cleaner and more consistent.
