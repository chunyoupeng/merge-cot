### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
queueService = injector.getInstance(QueueService.class);
      queueService.startAndWait();
||||||| base

=======
if (securityEnabled) {
        externalAuthenticationServer = injector.getInstance(ExternalAuthenticationServer.class);
        externalAuthenticationServer.startAndWait();
      }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In this case, the base is empty, and both branches `a` and `b` have added their own code independently.
   - Branch `a` added the following:
     ```java
     queueService = injector.getInstance(QueueService.class);
     queueService.startAndWait();
     ```
   - Branch `b` added the following:
     ```java
     if (securityEnabled) {
       externalAuthenticationServer = injector.getInstance(ExternalAuthenticationServer.class);
       externalAuthenticationServer.startAndWait();
     }
     ```
   - The conflict arises because both branches added new code at the same location (the top of the file), and Git cannot automatically merge them.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` introduces a `QueueService` that is started unconditionally.
   - Branch `b` introduces an `ExternalAuthenticationServer` that is started only if `securityEnabled` is true.
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes: one is for queue management, the other for security authentication.
   - Neither change should be discarded, as they are independent and serve different functionalities.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to initialize and start a queue service, likely for message handling or task processing.
   - The intention of `b` is to conditionally initialize and start an external authentication server, likely for security-related tasks.
   - These intentions are orthogonal and can coexist in the same codebase.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are valid and serve different purposes, the resolution should include both.
   - The code from `a` should be placed before the conditional block from `b` to maintain a logical flow: first initialize the queue service, then conditionally initialize the authentication server.
   - This preserves the clarity and correctness of the code.

```java
queueService = injector.getInstance(QueueService.class);
queueService.startAndWait();

if (securityEnabled) {
  externalAuthenticationServer = injector.getInstance(ExternalAuthenticationServer.class);
  externalAuthenticationServer.startAndWait();
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
queueService = injector.getInstance(QueueService.class);
      queueService.startAndWait();
      if (securityEnabled) {
        externalAuthenticationServer = injector.getInstance(ExternalAuthenticationServer.class);
        externalAuthenticationServer.startAndWait();
      }
