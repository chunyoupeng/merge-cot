### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public Mutator getType() {
    return mutator;
  }
||||||| base

=======
@Override
	public String toString() {
		return super.toString() + " Amount: " + by + " Default: " + def + " Exp: "
			+ exp;
	}
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different methods added by branches `a` and `b`.
   - Branch `a` added a method `getType()` that returns a `Mutator` object.
   - Branch `b` added a method `toString()` that overrides the default `toString()` method and returns a string representation of the object, including fields like `by`, `def`, and `exp`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `getType()` method in `a` is likely intended to provide access to a `mutator` field, which is a core part of the class's functionality.
   - The `toString()` method in `b` is a standard utility method for debugging and logging, which is also a valuable addition.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to expose the `mutator` field via a getter method, which is a common and clean design pattern.
   - The intention of `b` is to enhance the class's usability by providing a more informative string representation, which is also a common and useful practice.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both methods are independent and serve different purposes.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in functionality.
   - Therefore, both methods should be retained in the final merged code.
   - The resolution should include both the `getType()` method from `a` and the `toString()` method from `b`.

```java
public Mutator getType() {
    return mutator;
}

@Override
public String toString() {
    return super.toString() + " Amount: " + by + " Default: " + def + " Exp: "
        + exp;
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public Mutator getType() {
    return mutator;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return super.toString() + " Amount: " + by + " Default: " + def + " Exp: "
      + exp;
  }
