### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> public void setOutlineRule ( String rule ) { <newline> this . outlineRule = rule ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> @ Override <newline> public void setExpandToLevel ( int level ) { <newline> this . expandToLevel = level ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> @ Override <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> EditorState editorState


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the method `setOutlineRule(String rule)` and `setExpandToLevel(int level)`.
     - Removed the `@Override` annotation for `getOutline()` and changed the method to return `IStrategoTerm` without any parameters.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Kept the method `getOutline()` but added a parameter `EditorState editorState`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The removal of `setOutlineRule` and `setExpandToLevel` suggests that these methods are no longer needed or have been replaced.
     - The change to `getOutline()` implies that the method no longer depends on `EditorState`, which may indicate a simplification or a shift in design.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `EditorState editorState` to `getOutline()` suggests that the method now requires context from the editor state to compute the outline, which may be necessary for more accurate or dynamic behavior.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to simplify the API by removing setters and making `getOutline()` stateless.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to make `getOutline()` more context-aware by incorporating the `EditorState`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method `getOutline()` should be updated to include the `EditorState` parameter to maintain the functionality introduced in branch `b`.
   - The removal of `setOutlineRule` and `setExpandToLevel` from branch `a` should be preserved if those methods are no longer needed.
   - The final method should reflect the updated signature with the `EditorState` parameter and retain the return type from branch `a`.
