### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

private void throwIfTableMissingSecurityException(ThriftSecurityException e, Table.ID tableId, String tableName, TableOperation op)
      throws ThriftTableOperationException {

private void throwIfTableMissingSecurityException(ThriftSecurityException e, String tableId,
      String tableName, TableOperation op) throws ThriftTableOperationException {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> String <WITH> Table)
<ADD> . ID


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method signature uses `String tableId`.
   - In branch `a`, the parameter type is changed to `Table.ID tableId`, indicating a switch from a string representation to a more structured object type.
   - In branch `b`, the only change is the addition of a newline (likely for formatting), and no functional change is made to the method signature.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Replacing `String` with `Table.ID` suggests an intention to improve type safety and encapsulation. Using a dedicated `Table.ID` type instead of a raw string is a good design choice, as it can enforce constraints and provide better semantics.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The addition of a newline is purely cosmetic and does not affect the logic or functionality of the method. It is likely a formatting adjustment and can be safely ignored in the resolution.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To modernize the method by using a more robust and type-safe representation of the table ID.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To improve code formatting, which is a low-priority concern compared to functional correctness and type safety.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in branch `a` is functionally significant and improves the code quality.
   - The change in branch `b` is irrelevant to the core logic and can be safely ignored.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the method signature from branch `a`, which uses `Table.ID` as the type for the `tableId` parameter.
