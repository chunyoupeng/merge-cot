### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

||||||| base

public Object visit(OStatementSemicolon node, Object data);
  public Object visit(OStatementInternal node, Object data);
  public Object visit(OExpressionStatement node, Object data);
  public Object visit(OQueryStatement node, Object data);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, meaning there is no original content to compare against.
   - Branch `a` has added a list of method declarations for `visit` methods with different node types.
   - Branch `b` has also added a list of method declarations for `visit` methods with different node types.
   - The conflict arises because both branches have independently added their own versions of the same method declarations.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding method declarations for a visitor pattern, which is a common design pattern in compilers or interpreters.
   - The method signatures in both branches are identical in structure and naming, indicating that they are likely implementing the same functionality.
   - Since the base is empty, there is no original code to preserve or discard.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both branches is to define a set of `visit` methods for different node types, likely to implement a visitor interface.
   - There is no evidence that the two branches are implementing different logic or different sets of methods.
   - The duplication suggests that both branches are independently implementing the same interface or abstract class.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding the same method declarations and the base is empty, the most logical resolution is to merge the two sets of declarations.
   - However, since the content is identical, there is no need to add both sets. We can keep one set (either from `a` or `b`) to avoid redundancy.
   - The resolution should reflect the common intention of both branches: to define a visitor with these methods.
