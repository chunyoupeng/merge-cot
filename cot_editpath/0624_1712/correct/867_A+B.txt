### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the `onMessageReceived` method and the surrounding code.
   - **Branch a** introduces three new methods: `onSignedOut`, `onSignInFailed`, and `onMessageReceived`, all marked with `@Override` and containing `TODO: Implement` comments.
   - **Branch b** implements `onMessageReceived` with a call to `logAndToast`, and also defines two helper methods: `logAndToast(String message)` and `logAndToast(String message, Object value)`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** is likely adding placeholder methods for future implementation. This is useful for ensuring the class conforms to an interface or abstract class, but it does not provide any functionality yet.
   - **Branch b** is adding actual functionality to the `onMessageReceived` method, which is a clear implementation of the method's intended behavior. The helper methods are also useful for logging and user feedback.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** is likely scaffolding or stubbing out the class for future development.
   - **Branch b** is actively implementing the functionality of the class, particularly the message handling logic.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of **branch b** is more concrete and functional. The `onMessageReceived` method should be implemented with the logic from branch b.
   - The methods from **branch a** (`onSignedOut`, `onSignInFailed`) are also important for completeness and should be retained.
   - The helper methods from **branch b** (`logAndToast`) should be included to support the implementation.
   - The `TODO: Implement` comments from **branch a** can be removed since the method is now implemented.

```java
@Override
public void onSignedOut() {
    // TODO: Implement
}

@Override
public void onSignInFailed() {
    // TODO: Implement
}

@Override
public void onMessageReceived(String from, Bundle message) {
    logAndToast("Message received", message);
}

private void logAndToast(String message) {
    logAndToast(message, "");
}

private void logAndToast(String message, Object value) {
    String text = message + "//" + value;
    Log.d(TAG, text);
    Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), text, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
@Override
    public void onSignedOut() {
        // TODO: Implement
    }

    @Override
    public void onSignInFailed() {
        // TODO: Implement
    }

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(String from, Bundle message) {
        logAndToast("Message received", message);
    }

    private void logAndToast(String message) {
        logAndToast(message, "");
    }

    private void logAndToast(String message, Object value) {
        String text = message + "//" + value;
        Log.d(TAG, text);
        Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), text, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
