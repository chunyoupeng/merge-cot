### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public List<Notification> getReadyNotifications(@Bind("now") Date now, @Bind("max") int max, @Bind("queueName") String queueName);
||||||| base
public List<Notification> getReadyNotifications(@Bind("now") Date now, @Bind("max") int max, @Bind("queue_name") String queueName);
=======
public List<Notification> getReadyNotifications(@Bind("now") Date now, @Bind("owner") String owner, @Bind("max") int max, @Bind("queue_name") String queueName);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> queue_name <WITH> queueName)


## From base to b
<ADD> , @ Bind ( " owner " ) String owner


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method signature includes a parameter `@Bind("queue_name") String queueName`.
   - In branch `a`, the parameter name in the `@Bind` annotation is changed from `"queue_name"` to `"queueName"`.
   - In branch `b`, a new parameter `@Bind("owner") String owner` is added before the `max` parameter.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** The parameter name in the `@Bind` annotation is updated from `"queue_name"` to `"queueName"`. This is likely a naming convention change (e.g., from snake_case to camelCase), which is common in Java for consistency with variable naming. This change is minimal and does not affect the logic of the method.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** A new parameter `owner` is added to the method. This introduces a new binding, which implies that the method now needs to consider the `owner` when retrieving notifications. This is a functional enhancement and likely reflects a new business requirement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To align the parameter name in the `@Bind` annotation with Java naming conventions (camelCase), which is a cosmetic and stylistic change.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To add a new parameter `owner` to filter or scope the notifications based on ownership, which is a functional enhancement.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The change in `a` is a stylistic update, while the change in `b` is a functional addition.
   - Since the parameter `owner` is added before `max`, the order of parameters in the final method should reflect this.
   - The parameter name in the `@Bind` annotation should be updated to `"queueName"` to maintain consistency with Java naming conventions.
   - Therefore, the final method should include both the new `owner` parameter and the updated `@Bind("queueName")` annotation.
