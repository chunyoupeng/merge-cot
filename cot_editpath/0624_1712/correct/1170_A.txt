### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import stroom.importexport.shared.ImportState;
import stroom.security.Security;
||||||| base
import stroom.security.Insecure;
=======
import stroom.importexport.shared.ImportState;
import stroom.security.Insecure;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> import stroom . importexport . shared . ImportState ; <newline>
<REPLACE> Insecure <WITH> Security)


## From base to b
<ADD> import stroom . importexport . shared . ImportState ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the import `stroom.security.Insecure` is used.
   - Branch `a` replaces `Insecure` with `Security` and adds the import `stroom.importexport.shared.ImportState`.
   - Branch `b` also adds the import `stroom.importexport.shared.ImportState` but keeps `Insecure`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The addition of `import stroom.importexport.shared.ImportState;` is common to both `a` and `b`, so it is safe to include it in the final resolution.
   - The replacement of `Insecure` with `Security` in `a` suggests a move toward a more secure or updated API. This is likely a meaningful change, not just a stylistic one.
   - Branch `b` retains `Insecure`, which may indicate it is still compatible with the current system or that the change in `a` is not yet ready to be adopted in all contexts.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to modernize or secure the code by using `Security` instead of `Insecure`.
   - The intention of `b` is to add a new import without changing the existing logic, possibly for a new feature or bug fix that doesnâ€™t require the `Security` class.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches add the same import, it should be included.
   - The use of `Security` in `a` is a meaningful change that likely reflects an intentional update to the codebase. Therefore, it should be preserved.
   - The use of `Insecure` in `b` is outdated relative to `a`'s change and should be replaced.
   - The final code should reflect the updated and more secure approach from `a`.
