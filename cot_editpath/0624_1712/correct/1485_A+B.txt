### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> + " , requestType = " + requestType <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis = " + scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis <newline> + " ,
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the field `requestType` to the string representation of the `SingularityRequestBuilder`.
   - **Branch `b`** added the field `scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis` to the string representation.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `requestType` is a logical addition to the `toString()` method, as it provides more information about the request type, which is likely a core attribute of the object.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis` is also a logical addition, as it provides information about the expected runtime of scheduled tasks, which is relevant for debugging and logging.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** The intention is to include the `requestType` in the string representation to make it more informative and useful for debugging or logging purposes.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** The intention is to include the `scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis` in the string representation to provide more detailed information about the scheduling behavior of the request.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve the purpose of making the `toString()` method more informative.
   - Since both fields are added at different positions in the string, there is no overlap in the conflict.
   - The correct resolution is to include both `requestType` and `scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis` in the final `toString()` method.
   - The order of the fields should follow the order in which they were added in the respective branches, with `requestType` coming before `scheduledExpectedRuntimeMillis` to maintain consistency with the original order of the fields in the string.
