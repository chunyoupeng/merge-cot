### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new parameter `Type docValues` to the method signature.
   - **Branch `b`** added a full implementation of the method `addOrUpdateInternal`, including a return statement and the method body. It also added a newline and formatted the code in a more readable way.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a new parameter `Type docValues`, which likely represents a new feature or extension to the method's functionality. This is a minimal but meaningful change.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is more substantial. It adds the full implementation of the method `addOrUpdateInternal`, which is likely a new method that was not present in the base. This change is necessary for the method to be functional.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to extend the method's capabilities by adding a new parameter for `docValues`, which is a common pattern in APIs to support additional features.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to implement the `addOrUpdateInternal` method, which is a logical step if the method is being introduced or refactored.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method signature in `a` should be updated to include the `Type docValues` parameter.
   - The implementation from `b` should be preserved and adapted to include the new parameter.
   - The final method signature and implementation should reflect both changes, ensuring correctness and completeness.
