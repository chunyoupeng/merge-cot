### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> addDSProps ( properties ) ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the line `addDSProps(properties);` from the base code.
   - **Branch `b`** added the line `addDSProps(properties);` to the top of the code.
   - The rest of the code (the `SerializableRunnable` definitions for `disconnect` and `expectedException`) is identical in both `a` and `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing `addDSProps(properties);` suggests that the intention was to eliminate the configuration setup for the `DistributedSystem`. This might be because the configuration is no longer needed or is handled elsewhere.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `addDSProps(properties);` suggests that the intention was to ensure the `DistributedSystem` is properly configured before it is used (e.g., in the `disconnect` `SerializableRunnable`).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention appears to be to simplify or clean up the code by removing unnecessary configuration.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention appears to be to ensure the `DistributedSystem` is properly configured before it is used, which is important for correctness in a distributed system context.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `addDSProps(properties);` line is likely important for the correct behavior of the `DistributedSystem`, especially if the system relies on specific properties for its configuration.
   - Therefore, the change in **branch `b`** should be kept, and the change in **branch `a`** should be discarded.
   - The final code should include the `addDSProps(properties);` line at the top, followed by the `SerializableRunnable` definitions.
</cot>

```java
addDSProps(properties);
SerializableRunnable disconnect = new SerializableRunnable("Disconnect from " + locators) {
    public void run() {
        DistributedSystem sys = InternalDistributedSystem.getAnyInstance();
        if (sys != null && sys.isConnected()) {
            sys.disconnect();
        }
        MembershipManagerHelper.inhibitForcedDisconnectLogging(false);
    }
};
SerializableRunnable expectedException = new SerializableRunnable("Add expected exceptions") {
    public void run() {
        MembershipManagerHelper.inhibitForcedDisconnectLogging(true);
    }
};
```
