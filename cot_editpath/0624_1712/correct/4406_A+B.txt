### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - **Branch `a`** adds several imports related to TLS extensions such as `AlpnExtensionMessage`, `CertificateStatusRequestExtensionMessage`, `CertificateTypeExtensionMessage`, and `ClientAuthzExtensionMessage`.
   - **Branch `b`** adds imports for `ExtensionMessage`, `KeyShareExtensionMessage`, `SupportedVersionsExtensionMessage`, and a nested class `KeySharePair`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** appears to be adding support for various TLS extension types that are commonly used in TLS 1.2 and earlier. These extensions are related to client authentication, ALPN, and certificate status.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding support for newer TLS 1.3 features such as `KeyShareExtensionMessage` and `SupportedVersionsExtensionMessage`, which are essential for TLS 1.3 handshake mechanisms.
   - Both branches are adding imports for different TLS extension types, and there is no overlap in the specific classes being imported.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to support a broader range of TLS 1.2 and earlier extensions.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to support TLS 1.3 features, which are more modern and forward-looking.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding imports for different TLS extensions and there is no overlap or conflict in the actual code, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of imports**.
   - This ensures that the code supports both TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 features, which is likely the intended outcome of both branches.
   - The order of the imports can be preserved as per the original branches, or sorted alphabetically for clarity.
