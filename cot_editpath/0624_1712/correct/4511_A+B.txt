### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Criterion filterHql = SosTemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1);
        assertThat(filterHql.toString(), equalTo("resultTime=:resultTime1"));
||||||| base
Criterion filterHql = TemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1);
        assertThat(filterHql.toString(), equalTo("resultTime=:resultTime1"));
=======
Criterion filterHql = TemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1);
        assertThat(filterHql.toString(), equalTo("resultTime=:instant1"));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> TemporalRestrictions <WITH> SosTemporalRestrictions)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> resultTime1 <WITH> instant1)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the code uses `TemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1)` and expects the result to be `"resultTime=:resultTime1"`.
   - In `a`, the code replaces `TemporalRestrictions` with `SosTemporalRestrictions`, likely to use a different implementation of the `filterHql` method.
   - In `b`, the code keeps `TemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1)` but changes the expected result from `"resultTime=:resultTime1"` to `"resultTime=:instant1"`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** Replacing `TemporalRestrictions` with `SosTemporalRestrictions` suggests a switch to a different implementation, possibly for a specific feature or bug fix. This is a structural change and likely significant.
   - **Change in `b`:** Changing the expected result from `resultTime1` to `instant1` implies a change in the naming convention or behavior of the `filterHql` method. This could indicate a refactor or a bug fix in the method's output.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention in `a`:** The intention is to use a different implementation (`SosTemporalRestrictions`) of the `filterHql` method, possibly for compatibility with a new system or to fix a specific issue.
   - **Intention in `b`:** The intention is to update the expected output of the `filterHql` method, likely due to a refactor or a change in naming conventions (e.g., `resultTime` to `instant`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - If `a` is to be used, the `SosTemporalRestrictions` implementation must be compatible with the expected result in `b` (`"resultTime=:instant1"`). If it is not, the expected result should be updated accordingly.
   - If `b` is to be used, the `TemporalRestrictions` implementation must be compatible with the expected result (`"resultTime=:instant1"`). If `a` is to be used, the expected result should reflect the output of `SosTemporalRestrictions.filterHql`.

   Since both changes are significant and likely incompatible, the best resolution is to use the `SosTemporalRestrictions` implementation from `a` and update the expected result to match the new naming convention from `b`.

```java
Criterion filterHql = SosTemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1);
        assertThat(filterHql.toString(), equalTo("resultTime=:instant1"));
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
Criterion filterHql = SosTemporalRestrictions.filterHql(tf, 1);
        assertThat(filterHql.toString(), equalTo("resultTime=:instant1"));
