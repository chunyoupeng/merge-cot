### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public synchronized boolean isTotalFinalized(ObjectContainer container) {
||||||| base
public synchronized boolean isTotalFinalized() {
=======
@Override
	public synchronized boolean isTotalFinalized() {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ObjectContainer container


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Override <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a parameter `ObjectContainer container` to the method `isTotalFinalized()`.
   - **Branch `b`** added the `@Override` annotation to the method `isTotalFinalized()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding a parameter suggests that the method now depends on an external container object to determine the finalization state. This could indicate a change in the method's logic or a need for additional context.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `@Override` is a good practice if the method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface. It improves code clarity and helps catch errors during compilation if the method signature doesn't match the overridden method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To modify the method to accept an `ObjectContainer` as input, likely to provide more context or data for the finalization check.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To explicitly indicate that this method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface, which is a good practice for maintainability and correctness.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The `@Override` annotation should be retained to ensure clarity and correctness.
   - The parameter `ObjectContainer container` should also be retained if the method now requires it for its logic.
   - The conflict can be resolved by combining both changes: adding the `@Override` annotation and the `ObjectContainer container` parameter.
