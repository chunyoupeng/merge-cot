### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

CONCURRENCY, LCSAJ, DEFUSE, PATH, BRANCH, MUTATION, COMP_LCSAJ_BRANCH, STATEMENT, ANALYZE, DATA

CONCURRENCY, LCSAJ, DEFUSE, ALLDEFS, PATH, BRANCH, MUTATION, COMP_LCSAJ_BRANCH, STATEMENT, ANALYZE
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , DATA


## From base to b
<ADD> , ALLDEFS


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base line is: `CONCURRENCY, LCSAJ, DEFUSE, PATH, BRANCH, MUTATION, COMP_LCSAJ_BRANCH, STATEMENT, ANALYZE`
   - Branch `a` added the token `DATA` at the end.
   - Branch `b` added the token `ALLDEFS` after `DEFUSE`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `DATA` at the end of the list. This suggests that the developer in `a` intended to include `DATA` as a new item in the list of terms or categories.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `ALLDEFS` after `DEFUSE`. This implies that the developer in `b` wanted to introduce `ALLDEFS` as a new term or category, possibly related to `DEFUSE`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to expand the list by including `DATA`, likely to represent a new concept or category.
   - The intention of `b` is to expand the list by including `ALLDEFS`, likely to represent a broader or more specific variant of `DEFUSE`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are additive and do not conflict in terms of logic or order.
   - Since both `DATA` and `ALLDEFS` are new additions and do not interfere with each other, the best resolution is to merge both changes.
   - The order of the additions should be preserved as per the original intent of each branch: `ALLDEFS` after `DEFUSE` and `DATA` at the end.
