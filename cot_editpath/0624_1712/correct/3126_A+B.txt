### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

static private final String FILE_EXTESNION_CLAUSE = "(name LIKE '%." //NON-NLS
                + StringUtils.join(FileTypeUtils.getAllSupportedExtensions(),
                        "' or name LIKE '%.") //NON-NLS

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> / / NON - NLS / / NON - NLS


## From base to b
<REPLACE> FILE_EXTESNION_CLAUSE <WITH> FILE_EXTENSION_CLAUSE)
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<REPLACE> or <WITH> OR)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Added `//NON-NLS` comments to the string concatenation.
     - The spelling of the variable is `FILE_EXTESNION_CLAUSE` (misspelled).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Corrected the variable name to `FILE_EXTENSION_CLAUSE` (correct spelling).
     - Replaced `or` with `OR` for case consistency.
     - Added a newline for formatting.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The `//NON-NLS` comments are likely for marking non-localizable strings, which is a valid practice in some codebases.
     - However, the misspelled variable name is a problem and should be corrected.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Correcting the variable name is essential for code correctness.
     - Changing `or` to `OR` is a stylistic choice, but it may be necessary for consistency with the SQL dialect being used.
     - Adding a newline is a formatting improvement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intended to add localization annotations to the SQL clause.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intended to fix the variable name and improve SQL syntax consistency.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The variable name should be corrected to `FILE_EXTENSION_CLAUSE`.
   - The `//NON-NLS` comment should be retained if it is part of the project's localization strategy.
   - The `or` should be changed to `OR` for consistency.
   - The newline should be added for better formatting.

        "(name LIKE '%." //NON-NLS
                + StringUtils.join(FileTypeUtils.getAllSupportedExtensions(), "' OR name LIKE '%.") //NON-NLS
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
static private final String FILE_EXTENSION_CLAUSE =
                "(name LIKE '%." // NON-NLS
