### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added new code to a previously empty base.
   - Branch `a` introduces a new configuration parameter `maxFailoverCheckPeriod` with a default value of 300000 (5 minutes), along with getter and setter methods.
   - Branch `b` introduces a new configuration parameter `enlistInDistributedTransactions` with a default value of `false`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are independent and do not interfere with each other in terms of code structure or logic.
   - `maxFailoverCheckPeriod` is related to failover behavior and timing, while `enlistInDistributedTransactions` is related to transaction management.
   - Neither change modifies the same variable or method, so there is no direct conflict in the code logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a configurable timeout for failover checks.
   - The intention of `b` is to allow control over whether the system should participate in distributed transactions.
   - Both are valid and likely orthogonal features that can coexist in the same class.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and do not conflict with each other, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes into the final code.
   - The order of the fields can be preserved as in the original branches, or reordered for clarity if needed.
   - No modifications are necessary to either set of changes.
