### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public class DetectInspectorResolver implements DockerInspectorResolver, NugetInspectorResolver, PipInspectorResolver, GradleInspectorTemplateResolver {
||||||| base
public class DetectInspectorResolver implements NugetInspectorResolver, PipInspectorResolver, GradleInspectorTemplateResolver {
=======
// TODO: Implement this class
public class DetectInspectorResolver implements NugetInspectorResolver, PipInspectorResolver, GradleInspectorResolver {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> DockerInspectorResolver ,


## From base to b
<ADD> / / TODO : Implement this class <newline>
<REPLACE> GradleInspectorTemplateResolver <WITH> GradleInspectorResolver)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added `DockerInspectorResolver` to the list of implemented interfaces in the `DetectInspectorResolver` class.
   - **Branch `b`** added a TODO comment (`// TODO: Implement this class`) and changed `GradleInspectorTemplateResolver` to `GradleInspectorResolver`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `DockerInspectorResolver` likely indicates an intention to support Docker inspection functionality. This is a functional enhancement and should be preserved if the class is meant to support Docker.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The TODO comment suggests the class is not yet fully implemented, which may indicate it is a work in progress. The replacement of `GradleInspectorTemplateResolver` with `GradleInspectorResolver` likely reflects a naming correction or interface renaming. This change should be preserved if the Gradle interface has been renamed.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely extending the class's capabilities to support Docker.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely updating the class to reflect a new naming convention for Gradle and marking the class as incomplete.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The TODO comment from branch `b` should be preserved to indicate the class is not yet complete.
   - The addition of `DockerInspectorResolver` from branch `a` should be preserved to reflect the new functionality.
   - The replacement of `GradleInspectorTemplateResolver` with `GradleInspectorResolver` from branch `b` should be preserved to reflect the updated interface name.
   - The final class should include both the new interface and the updated interface name, while retaining the TODO comment.
