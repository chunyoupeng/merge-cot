### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added entirely new content to a previously empty base.
   - **Branch `a`** added a set of static final lists related to `ImageType`, `WindowTypeCapabilities`, `WindowCapability`, and `DisplayCapability`.
   - **Branch `b`** added a set of static final constants related to `MenuCell`, `VoiceCommand`, and their respective lists.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of changes are independent and do not overlap in terms of variables or functionality.
   - Branch `a` introduces UI or image-related constants, while branch `b` introduces menu and voice command-related constants.
   - Neither branch modifies the same variable or introduces conflicting logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to define a set of general-purpose image and window capabilities for UI or rendering logic.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to define general-purpose menu and voice command structures for user interaction or accessibility features.
   - The intentions are distinct and complementary, not conflicting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches add non-overlapping, independent functionality, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of changes**.
   - No logic is conflicting, and both sets of constants appear to be part of a broader configuration or setup for the application.
   - The resolution should preserve all constants from both branches in the final code.
