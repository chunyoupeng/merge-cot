### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> / / $ NON - NLS - 1 $ / / $ NON - NLS - 1 $ / / $ NON - NLS - 2 $


## From base to b
<ADD> { <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added multiple `//$NON-NLS-1$` and `//$NON-NLS-2$` comments to the code. These are typically used in Java to indicate that a string should not be localized (i.e., it's a literal that should not be translated).
   - **Branch `b`** added a pair of curly braces `{}` around the `if (ratio < 0)` block, making it a block statement. This is a stylistic change to improve readability and maintainability, especially if more statements are expected to be added in the future.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is about marking strings as non-localizable. This is important in internationalization (i18n) contexts to ensure that certain strings (like error messages) are not translated. The addition of multiple `//$NON-NLS-1$` and `//$NON-NLS-2$` comments appears to be redundant or possibly a mistake, but the intention is to ensure the strings are not localized.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is about code style and structure. Adding braces around a single-line `if` statement is a common best practice to prevent future bugs if more statements are added to the block.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to ensure that the error messages are not localized, which is important in applications that support multiple languages.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to improve code readability and reduce the risk of bugs by following a common style guideline.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The `//$NON-NLS-1$` and `//$NON-NLS-2$` comments should be included to ensure the strings are not localized.
   - The braces should also be included to follow best practices for code structure.
   - The final code should combine both changes: include the localization comments and add the braces for the `if` block.
