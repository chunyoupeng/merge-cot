### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> this <WITH> assertThatIOException)
<ADD> ( ) <newline>
<REPLACE> thrown <WITH> isThrownBy)
<REPLACE> . <WITH> ()
<REPLACE> expect <WITH> ()
<ADD> ) - > testRestrictedSSLProtocolsAndCipherSuites
<DELETE> anyOf ( instanceOf ( SSLException . class ) , instanceOf ( SocketException . class ) ) ) ; <newline> testRestrictedSSLProtocolsAndCipherSuites (
<ADD> ) <newline> . isInstanceOfAny ( SSLException . class , SocketException . class )


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `this.thrown.expect(...)` with `assertThatIOException().isThrownBy(...)`.
     - Moved the method call `testRestrictedSSLProtocolsAndCipherSuites(...)` inside the `isThrownBy(...)` block.
     - Replaced `anyOf(...)` with `isInstanceOfAny(...)`, which is a more concise and readable assertion.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - No actual content change is visible in the diff. It appears to be a formatting or whitespace-only change (e.g., removing a newline).
     - No functional logic was modified in `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change to use `assertThatIOException().isThrownBy(...)` is a modern and more expressive way of writing assertions in JUnit 5.
     - Moving the method call into the `isThrownBy(...)` block ensures that the exception is thrown by the actual method call, which is semantically correct.
     - Replacing `anyOf(...)` with `isInstanceOfAny(...)` is a stylistic improvement and aligns with JUnit 5 best practices.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - No functional change was made, so it has no impact on the logic or correctness of the test.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to modernize the test code to use JUnit 5's more expressive assertion syntax.
     - The goal is to make the test more readable and maintainable.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention appears to be minimalâ€”likely a formatting cleanup or whitespace adjustment.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` introduces a more modern and semantically correct way of writing the test, and `b` introduces no functional change, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from `a`.
   - The test should use `assertThatIOException().isThrownBy(...)` and `isInstanceOfAny(...)` for clarity and correctness.

        .isThrownBy(() -> testRestrictedSSLProtocolsAndCipherSuites(
                new String[] { "TLSv1.1" },
                new String[] { "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256" }))
        .isInstanceOfAny(SSLException.class, SocketException.class);
