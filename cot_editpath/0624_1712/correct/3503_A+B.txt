### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

// for example: TODO(YilongL)
                        PatternMatcher lookupMatcher = new PatternMatcher(rule.containsAttribute("lemma"), context);

// for example: L:List[Int(#"0")] = '#ostream(_)(I:Int), where L is the output buffer

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> rule . containsAttribute ( " lemma " ) ,


## From base to b
<REPLACE> TODO <WITH> L)
<ADD> : List [ Int
<REPLACE> YilongL <WITH> #)
<ADD> " 0 " ) ] = ' # ostream ( _ ) ( I : Int ) , where L is the output buffer <newline> / / = > ' # ostream ( _ ) ( Int ( # " 1 " ) ) = ? ' # ostream ( _ ) ( I : Int


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     PatternMatcher lookupMatcher = new PatternMatcher(context);
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is modified to:
     ```java
     PatternMatcher lookupMatcher = new PatternMatcher(rule.containsAttribute("lemma"), context);
     ```
     This adds a new parameter `rule.containsAttribute("lemma")` to the constructor of `PatternMatcher`.
   - In branch `b`, the line is unchanged in terms of Java code, but the surrounding comments have been significantly modified to include a detailed example and explanation of the logic.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding the `rule.containsAttribute("lemma")` parameter likely introduces a new condition or flag to the `PatternMatcher` constructor. This suggests that the logic of the `PatternMatcher` now depends on whether the rule has a "lemma" attribute. This is a functional change that affects the behavior of the code.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The changes are purely in the comments. They provide a more detailed explanation of the logic and an example of how the `PatternMatcher` is used. These are documentation changes and do not affect the runtime behavior of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to enhance the functionality of the `PatternMatcher` by incorporating a new condition based on the presence of a "lemma" attribute in the rule. This is a logical and meaningful change that likely improves the correctness or expressiveness of the code.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to improve the clarity and documentation of the code. The added comments help future developers understand the purpose and usage of the `PatternMatcher` in this context.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The functional change in branch `a` should be preserved because it introduces a new condition that affects the behavior of the `PatternMatcher`.
   - The documentation improvements in branch `b` should also be preserved, as they enhance the readability and maintainability of the code.
   - Since the two changes are orthogonal (one affects functionality, the other affects documentation), they can be merged without conflict.

```java
// for example: L:List[Int(#"0")] = '#ostream(_)(I:Int), where L is the output buffer
//           => '#ostream(_)(Int(#"1")) =? '#ostream(_)(I:Int)
PatternMatcher lookupMatcher = new PatternMatcher(rule.containsAttribute("lemma"), context);
```

                        //           => '#ostream(_)(Int(#"1")) =? '#ostream(_)(I:Int)
