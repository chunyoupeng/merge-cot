### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public ShortUrlStatistics getDailyStatistics(ShortUrl shortUrl,
      int maxValues) throws IOException {
||||||| base
public ShortUrlStatistics getDailyStatistics(ShortUrl shortUrl, int maxValues)
      throws IOException {
=======
public ShortUrlStatistics getDailyStatistics(ShortUrl shortUrl, int maxValues)
    throws IOException {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the method `getDailyStatistics`. 
   - In `base`, the method is defined with a line break after the parameter list and the `throws IOException` clause is on the next line.
   - In `a`, the method is defined with the `throws IOException` clause on the same line as the parameter list, and there is an explicit `<ADD> <newline>` and `<DELETE> <newline>` indicating a reformatting of the line breaks.
   - In `b`, the method is defined with the `throws IOException` clause on the next line, similar to the `base` version.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` changed the formatting by placing the `throws IOException` on the same line as the parameter list. This is a stylistic change and does not affect functionality.
   - `b` kept the formatting consistent with the `base` version, which is also a stylistic choice.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` seems to be to reduce the number of lines in the method declaration for a more compact style.
   - The intention of `b` seems to be to maintain the original formatting for readability and consistency with the base code.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are stylistic and do not affect the functionality of the code, the resolution should preserve the functional correctness and choose a consistent style.
   - Given that `a` explicitly modifies the line breaks, it suggests a preference for compact formatting.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the formatting from `a` to reflect the change in style while maintaining correctness.
