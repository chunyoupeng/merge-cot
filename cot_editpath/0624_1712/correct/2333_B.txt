### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
final WebResource webResource       = new WebResource(apiProvider);
=======
final JsonWebTokenUtils jsonWebTokenUtils = mock(JsonWebTokenUtils.class);
        final WebResource webResource       = new WebResource(apiProvider, jsonWebTokenUtils);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> final JsonWebTokenUtils jsonWebTokenUtils = mock ( JsonWebTokenUtils . class ) ; <newline> , jsonWebTokenUtils


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the line: `final WebResource webResource = new WebResource(apiProvider);`
   - **Branch `b`** added a new variable: `final JsonWebTokenUtils jsonWebTokenUtils = mock(JsonWebTokenUtils.class);` and modified the constructor call to `new WebResource(apiProvider, jsonWebTokenUtils);` by adding the `jsonWebTokenUtils` parameter.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** completely removed the `webResource` line. This could indicate a refactoring or removal of the `WebResource` usage, but it's unclear why the line was removed without context.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new dependency (`jsonWebTokenUtils`) to the `WebResource` constructor, suggesting that the `WebResource` class now requires this utility for its functionality. This is a logical and backward-compatible change if the constructor was updated to accept the new parameter.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** may have removed the `webResource` line to eliminate unused code or to refactor the class entirely.
   - **Branch `b`** likely added the `jsonWebTokenUtils` to enhance the `WebResource` functionality, possibly to support JWT-based authentication or token handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since **branch `b`** is adding a new, necessary dependency to the `WebResource` constructor, it is likely the correct and more complete version of the code.
   - **Branch `a`** removing the `webResource` line may be a mistake or a partial refactor that doesn't account for the updated constructor.
   - Therefore, the resolution should keep the changes from **branch `b`** and discard the removal from **branch `a`**.

### Gold (Ground Truth)
final JsonWebTokenUtils jsonWebTokenUtils = mock(JsonWebTokenUtils.class);
        final WebResource webResource       = new WebResource(apiProvider, jsonWebTokenUtils);
