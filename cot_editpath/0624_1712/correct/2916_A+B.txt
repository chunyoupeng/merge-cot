### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

assertThat(sdkPicker.selectSdks(buildConfig(new Config.Builder()), usesSdk))
        .containsExactly(sdkProvider.getSdk(22));
||||||| base

=======
assertThat(sdkPicker.selectSdks(new Config.Builder().build(), usesSdk))
        .containsExactly(sdkCollection.getSdk(22));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ( buildConfig
<DELETE> . build (


## From base to b
<REPLACE> sdkProvider <WITH> sdkCollection)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     assertThat(sdkPicker.selectSdks(new Config.Builder().build(), usesSdk))
             .containsExactly(sdkProvider.getSdk(22));
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the code is changed to:
     ```java
     assertThat(sdkPicker.selectSdks(buildConfig(new Config.Builder()), usesSdk))
             .containsExactly(sdkProvider.getSdk(22));
     ```
     The change is from `new Config.Builder().build()` to `buildConfig(new Config.Builder())`. This suggests that `a` is introducing a new method `buildConfig` to wrap the `Config.Builder` creation.
   - In branch `b`, the code is changed to:
     ```java
     assertThat(sdkPicker.selectSdks(new Config.Builder().build(), usesSdk))
             .containsExactly(sdkCollection.getSdk(22));
     ```
     The change is from `sdkProvider.getSdk(22)` to `sdkCollection.getSdk(22)`. This suggests that `b` is replacing the `sdkProvider` with `sdkCollection` as the source of SDKs.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Replacing `new Config.Builder().build()` with `buildConfig(new Config.Builder())` likely introduces a helper method to encapsulate or modify the configuration building process. This is a structural change that could be useful for abstraction or future extensibility.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Replacing `sdkProvider` with `sdkCollection` is a semantic change. It implies that the SDKs are now being sourced from a different object (`sdkCollection`), which may represent a different data structure or logic for retrieving SDKs.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To encapsulate the configuration building logic into a method (`buildConfig`) for better readability, abstraction, or to allow for future configuration modifications without changing the test.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To switch the source of SDKs from `sdkProvider` to `sdkCollection`, which may reflect a change in the system's architecture or a new way of managing SDKs.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The `buildConfig` method from `a` is a structural improvement, while the switch to `sdkCollection` from `b` is a semantic change.
   - To preserve both intentions, we should combine the two changes: use the `buildConfig` method from `a` and use `sdkCollection` from `b`.
   - Therefore, the correct merged line should use `buildConfig(new Config.Builder())` and `sdkCollection.getSdk(22)`.
