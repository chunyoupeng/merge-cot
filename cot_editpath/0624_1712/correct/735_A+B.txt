### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added new configuration options and corresponding methods.
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Introduces a new boolean field `teleportBackWhenFreedFromJail`.
     - Adds a private method `_isTeleportBackWhenFreedFromJail()` that reads the configuration value.
     - Adds an overridden method `isTeleportBackWhenFreedFromJail()` that returns the field.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduces two new boolean fields: `isCompassTowardsHomePerm` and `isAllowWorldInBroadcastworld`.
     - Adds two private methods: `_isCompassTowardsHomePerm()` and `_isAllowWorldInBroadcastworld()` that read their respective configuration values.
     - Adds two overridden methods: `isCompassTowardsHomePerm()` and `isAllowWorldInBroadcastworld()` that return the fields.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding new configuration options and encapsulating them with private methods and overridden getters.
   - These changes are **independent** of each other and do not interfere with one another.
   - There is **no overlap** in the names or logic of the fields or methods.
   - The naming and structure are consistent across both branches (e.g., `_is...()` for config access, `is...()` for overridden getters).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both branches is to **add new configurable features** to the class.
   - Branch `a` is focused on teleportation behavior when a player is freed from jail.
   - Branch `b` is focused on permissions and world-related broadcasting behavior.
   - Both aim to **encapsulate configuration values** and provide clean accessors.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the changes are **independent**, **non-conflicting**, and **logically distinct**, the best resolution is to **merge both sets of changes**.
   - No code needs to be discarded or modified.
   - The final code should include all the new fields, private methods, and overridden getters from both branches.
