### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import org.jasig.cas.support.saml.util.DefaultSaml20ObjectBuilder;
||||||| base

=======
import org.jasig.cas.support.saml.util.GoogleSaml20ObjectBuilder;
import org.jasig.cas.util.ISOStandardDateFormat;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> GoogleSaml20ObjectBuilder <WITH> DefaultSaml20ObjectBuilder)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> import org . jasig . cas . util . ISOStandardDateFormat ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the import is `org.jasig.cas.support.saml.util.GoogleSaml20ObjectBuilder`.
   - Branch `a` replaces `GoogleSaml20ObjectBuilder` with `DefaultSaml20ObjectBuilder`.
   - Branch `b` adds a new import for `org.jasig.cas.util.ISOStandardDateFormat`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** This is a direct replacement of the `GoogleSaml20ObjectBuilder` with `DefaultSaml20ObjectBuilder`. This likely reflects a change in the implementation logic or dependency, possibly to use a more standard or default implementation.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** This is an addition of a new import for `ISOStandardDateFormat`, which is likely used for date formatting in the code. This is a non-conflicting addition and does not interfere with the import in `a`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to switch the implementation of the `Saml20ObjectBuilder` from a Google-specific one to a default one. This could be for compatibility, standardization, or to remove dependency on Google-specific code.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to add a utility class for date formatting, which is likely used in the codebase for consistent date handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two changes are independent and do not conflict with each other. The replacement in `a` should be kept, and the addition in `b` should also be kept.
   - The final import list should include both `DefaultSaml20ObjectBuilder` and `ISOStandardDateFormat`.
