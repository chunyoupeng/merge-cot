### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import us.ihmc.sensorProcessing.outputData.JointDesiredOutputWriter;
import us.ihmc.sensorProcessing.parameters.DRCRobotSensorInformation;
||||||| base
import us.ihmc.sensorProcessing.parameters.DRCRobotSensorInformation;
=======
import us.ihmc.sensorProcessing.parameters.HumanoidRobotSensorInformation;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> import us . ihmc . sensorProcessing . outputData . JointDesiredOutputWriter ; <newline>


## From base to b
<REPLACE> DRCRobotSensorInformation <WITH> HumanoidRobotSensorInformation)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new import: `import us.ihmc.sensorProcessing.outputData.JointDesiredOutputWriter;`.
   - **Branch `b`** replaced the import `DRCRobotSensorInformation` with `HumanoidRobotSensorInformation`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The addition in `a` introduces a new dependency for writing joint desired outputs, which may be necessary for new functionality.
   - The replacement in `b` suggests a generalization or abstraction from a specific robot (`DRC`) to a more general humanoid robot type. This could be part of a broader effort to make the codebase more modular or reusable across different robot types.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` likely aims to add new control or output functionality for joints.
   - `b` likely aims to refactor the code to support a more generic humanoid robot interface, which is a common practice in robotics software to improve reusability.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are likely orthogonal: one adds a new import for joint output writing, and the other generalizes the sensor information class.
   - Therefore, both changes should be retained in the merged result.
   - The order of imports is not semantically significant in Java, so we can preserve the order as in the final resolution.
