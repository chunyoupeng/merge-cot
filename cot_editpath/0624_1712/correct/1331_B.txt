### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code submits two `TickerRunnable` tasks to an `executorService` for `btcusdStreamingMarketDataService` and `btceurStreamingMarketDataService`.
   - **Branch a** has no changes from the base.
   - **Branch b** adds the following:
     - Assigns the returned `Future<?>` objects from `executorService.submit(...)` to `btcusd` and `btceur`.
     - Calls `btcusd.get()` and `btceur.get()` to wait for the tasks to complete.
     - Calls `executorService.shutdown()` to shut down the executor.
     - Prints a message and calls `disconnect()` on both services.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** has no changes, so it's neutral.
   - **Branch b** introduces synchronization and cleanup logic:
     - `get()` ensures the tasks complete before proceeding.
     - `shutdown()` is a good practice to prevent resource leaks.
     - `disconnect()` is likely important for releasing resources or ending connections.
   - These changes are **constructive** and improve correctness and robustness.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely focuses on functionality without worrying about synchronization or cleanup.
   - **Branch b** aims to ensure the tasks complete before shutting down and disconnecting, which is important for correctness in a real-world application.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in **branch b** are more comprehensive and align with best practices for managing threads and resources.
   - The code from **branch b** should be kept, with minor formatting adjustments to align with the base's indentation and style.

```java
Future<?> btcusd = executorService.submit(new TickerRunnable(btcusdStreamingMarketDataService));
    Future<?> btceur = executorService.submit(new TickerRunnable(btceurStreamingMarketDataService));

    btcusd.get();
    btceur.get();

    executorService.shutdown();

    // TODO disconnect() currently shuts down all SocketIO traffic
    // Disconnect and exit
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": Disconnecting...");
    btcusdStreamingMarketDataService.disconnect();
    btceurStreamingMarketDataService.disconnect();
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
Future<?> btcusd = executorService.submit(new TickerRunnable(btcusdStreamingMarketDataService));
    Future<?> btceur = executorService.submit(new TickerRunnable(btceurStreamingMarketDataService));

    btcusd.get();
    btceur.get();

    executorService.shutdown();

    // TODO disconnect() currently shuts down all SocketIO traffic
    // Disconnect and exit
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ": Disconnecting...");
    btcusdStreamingMarketDataService.disconnect();
    btceurStreamingMarketDataService.disconnect();
