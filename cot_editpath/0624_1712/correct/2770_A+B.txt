### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
null, outstandingLoanBalance);
||||||| base
null);
=======
null,submittedOnDate);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , outstandingLoanBalance


## From base to b
<ADD> , submittedOnDate


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line ends with `null)`.
   - In branch `a`, the line is modified to `null, outstandingLoanBalance)`, meaning a new parameter `outstandingLoanBalance` is added.
   - In branch `b`, the line is modified to `null, submittedOnDate)`, meaning a new parameter `submittedOnDate` is added instead.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are adding a new parameter to the same method call. The base version only has `null` as the last argument.
   - The changes in `a` and `b` are mutually exclusive at the token level â€” both are trying to insert a new parameter in the same position.
   - The correctness of the code depends on the method's expected parameters and the business logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` is likely adding a financial parameter (`outstandingLoanBalance`) to track loan-related data.
   - `b` is likely adding a timestamp (`submittedOnDate`) to track when a form or request was submitted.
   - Both changes are valid in their own contexts and likely serve different purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both parameters are relevant and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to include both parameters in the method call.
   - The order of the parameters should be considered based on the method's expected signature or logical grouping. If the method expects these parameters in a specific order, that should be followed.
   - If no such order is defined, we can assume the order from the branches is acceptable or logically grouped (e.g., financial data first, then timestamp).
