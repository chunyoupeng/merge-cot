### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

      CrashReport crashReport, long appId, String packageName, PermissionManager permissionManager,

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> , long appId , String packageName


## From base to b
<REPLACE> scheduler <WITH> viewScheduler)
<ADD> , PermissionManager permissionManager , <newline> PermissionService permissionService


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the parameters `long appId, String packageName` from the method signature.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Renamed the parameter `scheduler` to `viewScheduler`.
     - Added two new parameters: `PermissionManager permissionManager` and `PermissionService permissionService`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - Removing `appId` and `packageName` suggests that these parameters are no longer needed in this method.
     - This could indicate a simplification of the method or a refactoring where these values are now handled elsewhere.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - Renaming `scheduler` to `viewScheduler` implies a more specific naming to clarify the purpose of the scheduler.
     - Adding `PermissionManager` and `PermissionService` suggests that the method now requires permission-related functionality, likely for handling app permissions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to reduce the number of parameters by removing those that are no longer necessary.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to improve clarity by renaming the scheduler and to add new functionality related to permission management.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The removal of `appId` and `packageName` by `a` should be kept if these parameters are indeed no longer needed.
   - The renaming of `scheduler` to `viewScheduler` by `b` should be kept for clarity.
   - The addition of `PermissionManager` and `PermissionService` by `b` should be kept to support the new functionality.
   - Therefore, the final method signature should include the renamed scheduler and the new permission-related parameters, while omitting `appId` and `packageName`.
