### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
String textContent = StringUtil.trimToEmpty(XMLUtil.getTextContent(node));
||||||| base
String textContent = StringUtils.trimToEmpty(XMLUtil.getTextContent(node));
=======
String textContent = StringUtils.trimToEmpty(XMLUtil.getTextContent(node));
        textContent = escapeXml(textContent);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> StringUtils <WITH> StringUtil)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> textContent = escapeXml ( textContent ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is: `String textContent = StringUtils.trimToEmpty(XMLUtil.getTextContent(node));`
   - In branch `a`, the change is: `StringUtils` is replaced with `StringUtil`.
   - In branch `b`, an additional line is added: `textContent = escapeXml(textContent);` after the initial assignment.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change:** Replacing `StringUtils` with `StringUtil` likely indicates a renaming or refactoring of the utility class. This change is minimal and does not affect the logic of the code, only the class name.
   - **Branch `b` change:** Adding `escapeXml(textContent)` introduces a new behaviorâ€”escaping the XML content. This is a functional change that adds a new step in the processing of `textContent`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To refactor the code by renaming the utility class from `StringUtils` to `StringUtil`. This is likely a code cleanup or modernization effort.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To enhance the functionality by ensuring that the text content is properly escaped for XML output. This is a functional enhancement.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The renaming in `a` is a refactor that should be preserved. The addition in `b` is a functional enhancement that should also be preserved.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both changes: use `StringUtil` (from `a`) and add the `escapeXml` call (from `b`).

```java
String textContent = StringUtil.trimToEmpty(XMLUtil.getTextContent(node));
textContent = escapeXml(textContent);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
String textContent = StringUtil.trimToEmpty(XMLUtil.getTextContent(node));
        textContent = escapeXml(textContent);
