### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage subscribeMessage = new GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage(SUBSCRIBE, product);
||||||| base
GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage subscribeMessage = new GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage(SUBSCRIBE, product);
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
=======
GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage subscribeMessage = new GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage(SUBSCRIBE, product, authData.get());
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper ( ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> , authData . get ( )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the line is:
     ```java
     GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage subscribeMessage = new GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage(SUBSCRIBE, product);
     ```
   - In `a`, the line is the same as in `base`, but the next line:
     ```java
     ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
     ```
     has been **deleted**.
   - In `b`, the line is modified to:
     ```java
     GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage subscribeMessage = new GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage(SUBSCRIBE, product, authData.get());
     ```
     and the next line:
     ```java
     ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
     ```
     is **unchanged**.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** The deletion of `ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();` suggests that the code in `a` no longer needs this object. This could be due to a refactoring or optimization where the `ObjectMapper` is no longer used in this context.
   - **Change in `b`:** The addition of `authData.get()` as a third argument to the `GDAXWebSocketSubscriptionMessage` constructor indicates that authentication data is now being passed to the subscription message. This is likely a feature enhancement or a requirement for secure communication.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention in `a`:** To remove unused or unnecessary code (the `ObjectMapper`), likely to clean up or optimize the code.
   - **Intention in `b`:** To enhance the subscription message by including authentication data, which may be necessary for the API to accept the subscription.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The addition of `authData.get()` in `b` is a meaningful and necessary change for the functionality of the subscription message.
   - The deletion of the `ObjectMapper` in `a` is likely safe if the `ObjectMapper` is no longer used elsewhere in the code. However, we should ensure that the `ObjectMapper` is not required for any other part of the code that may be affected by this deletion.
   - Since the `ObjectMapper` is not used in the current context and the `authData.get()` is a meaningful addition, the best resolution is to **keep the `authData.get()` from `b` and remove the `ObjectMapper` as in `a`**.
