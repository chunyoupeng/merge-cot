### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* @version @__version__@ &mdash; <em>$Date: 2014-02-04 $</em>
||||||| base
* @version 1.2 &mdash; <em>$Date: 2013-12-05 $</em>
=======
* @version 1.2 &mdash; <em>$Date: 2014-02-15 $</em>
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> 1 <WITH> @)
<REPLACE> . <WITH> __version__)
<REPLACE> 2 <WITH> @)
<REPLACE> 2013 <WITH> 2014)
<REPLACE> 12 <WITH> 02)
<REPLACE> 05 <WITH> 04)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> 2013 <WITH> 2014)
<REPLACE> 12 <WITH> 02)
<REPLACE> 05 <WITH> 15)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base version is:
     ```
     * @version 1.2 &mdash; <em>$Date: 2013-12-05 $</em>
     ```
   - Branch `a` modifies it to:
     ```
     * @version @__version__@ &mdash; <em>$Date: 2014-02-04 $</em>
     ```
     This involves:
     - Replacing `1.2` with `@__version__@` (likely a placeholder for versioning).
     - Updating the date to `2014-02-04`.
   - Branch `b` modifies it to:
     ```
     * @version 1.2 &mdash; <em>$Date: 2014-02-15 $</em>
     ```
     This involves:
     - Keeping the version as `1.2`.
     - Updating the date to `2014-02-15`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes:**
     - Replacing the version number with a placeholder (`@__version__@`) suggests an intention to automate versioning or use a build system to inject the version at build time.
     - Updating the date to `2014-02-04` reflects a specific timestamp change.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes:**
     - Keeping the version number as `1.2` implies the version has not changed.
     - Updating the date to `2014-02-15` reflects a different timestamp change.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to transition from a static version number to a dynamic one, possibly for automation or CI/CD integration.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to update the date to reflect a more recent timestamp without changing the version number, perhaps for documentation or release tracking.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The version number placeholder (`@__version__@`) from `a` is a more flexible and modern approach for versioning.
   - The date from `b` (`2014-02-15`) is more recent than the one from `a` (`2014-02-04`), so it should be used to reflect the latest timestamp.
   - Therefore, the resolution should combine the placeholder version from `a` with the updated date from `b`.
