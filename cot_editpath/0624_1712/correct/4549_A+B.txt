### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
return new ResourceResponse(savedResourceWithRelations, jsonPath, queryParams, metaInformation,
            linksInformation);
||||||| base
return new ResourceResponse(savedResourceWithRelations, jsonPath, requestParams, metaInformation, linksInformation);
=======
return new ResourceResponse(savedResourceWithRelations, jsonPath, requestParams, metaInformation, linksInformation,
            HttpStatus.CREATED_201);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> requestParams <WITH> queryParams)
<ADD> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> HttpStatus . CREATED_201


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method returns a `ResourceResponse` with the parameter `requestParams`.
   - In branch `a`, the parameter `requestParams` is replaced with `queryParams`, and a newline is added.
   - In branch `b`, the `ResourceResponse` constructor is extended to include `HttpStatus.CREATED_201` as an additional parameter, and a comma and newline are added.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change (`requestParams` â†’ `queryParams`):** This suggests that the intention is to use a different parameter object (`queryParams`) instead of the original `requestParams`. This could be due to a change in how parameters are processed or sourced.
   - **Branch `b` change (adding `HttpStatus.CREATED_201`):** This indicates that the intention is to explicitly set the HTTP status code to 201 (Created), which is a common response for successful creation operations. This is a semantic enhancement to the response.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to switch the parameter source from `requestParams` to `queryParams`, which might be a more appropriate or updated way to handle the parameters in the context of the application.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to enhance the response by explicitly setting the HTTP status to 201, which is a best practice when a resource is successfully created.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are semantically meaningful and serve different purposes. `a` changes the parameter source, while `b` adds a new parameter for the HTTP status.
   - The correct resolution is to **combine both changes**: use `queryParams` instead of `requestParams` and include `HttpStatus.CREATED_201` as the new parameter.
   - This ensures that the updated parameter source is used and the HTTP status is explicitly set, aligning with best practices and the intentions of both branches.
