### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is centered around a code block that checks whether a step is too wide for a robot footstep planner. The base version includes a condition that checks if the step width exceeds a maximum allowed value, depending on whether the robot is on the left or right side.
   - **Branch `a`** has modified the condition to include an additional check for `stepFromParentInSoleFrame.getY() > maximumStepWidth` for the left side and `stepFromParentInSoleFrame.getY() < -maximumStepWidth` for the right side.
   - **Branch `b`** has completely replaced the base code with a new version that includes a different condition: `stepFromParentInSoleFrame.getY() < -maximumStepWidth` for the left side and `stepFromParentInSoleFrame.getY() > maximumStepWidth` for the right side. This is the inverse of what is in `a`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be enforcing a stricter limit on the step width for the left side (greater than `maximumStepWidth`) and the right side (less than `-maximumStepWidth`). This is a logical and intuitive way to enforce a maximum step width.
   - **Branch `b`** appears to be enforcing the opposite condition: for the left side, it checks if the step width is less than `-maximumStepWidth`, and for the right side, it checks if it is greater than `maximumStepWidth`. This is the inverse of what `a` does and may be a mistake or a misunderstanding of the intended logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to ensure that the robot does not take steps that are wider than the allowed maximum, which is a reasonable constraint for a footstep planner.
   - **Branch `b`** may have misunderstood the logic or intended to implement a different constraint, but the condition seems to contradict the expected behavior of limiting step width.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Based on the logic and correctness, **branch `a`**'s condition is the correct and expected implementation for enforcing a maximum step width. Branch `b`'s condition appears to be the inverse and likely incorrect.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the logic from branch `a`.

               || ((robotSide == RobotSide.RIGHT) && (stepFromParentInSoleFrame.getY() < -maximumStepWidth)))
         {
