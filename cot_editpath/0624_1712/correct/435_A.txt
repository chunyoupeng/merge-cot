### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* Wait for a Stream to become available or transition to the indicated status
	 *
||||||| base
* Wait for a Stream to become available or transition to the indicated
	 * status
	 *
=======
* Wait for a Stream to become available or transition to the indicated
	 * status
	 *
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> *



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the comment line is split into two lines:
     ```
     * Wait for a Stream to become available or transition to the indicated
         * status
         *
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the first line is modified by removing the newline and the `*` at the end of the first line, resulting in:
     ```
     * Wait for a Stream to become available or transition to the indicated status
         *
     ```
   - In branch `b`, the comment is left unchanged from the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` merges the two lines into one, making the comment more concise and readable.
   - The change in `b` keeps the original formatting, which may be less readable due to the extra newline and indentation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to improve readability by removing unnecessary line breaks and making the comment more compact.
   - The intention in `b` is to preserve the original formatting, possibly for consistency with other parts of the codebase or for stylistic reasons.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the change in `a` improves readability without altering the meaning of the comment, it is preferable to keep this change.
   - The formatting in `b` is less optimal and does not add any functional value.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the version from `a`.
