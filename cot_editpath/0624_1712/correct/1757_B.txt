### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* Add a boundary event
     *
||||||| base
* Add a boundary event
     *
=======
* Adds a boundary event
     *
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Add <WITH> Adds)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the line: `* Add a boundary event`.
   - In `base`, the line is: `* Add a boundary event`.
   - In `a`, the line is the same as in `base`: `* Add a boundary event`.
   - In `b`, the line is changed to: `* Adds a boundary event`.

   The only difference is the use of "Add" in `a` and `base` versus "Adds" in `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` made no change to this line compared to `base`.
   - `b` changed "Add" to "Adds", which is a grammatical correction if the sentence is part of a list or a description of a feature that is already being performed.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` likely intended to keep the original wording, possibly for consistency or stylistic reasons.
   - `b` likely intended to improve the grammatical correctness of the sentence, especially if it's part of a larger sentence or list.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b`'s change is grammatically correct and improves clarity, it should be preferred.
   - There is no functional or logical conflict, only a stylistic one.
   - The resolution should adopt `b`'s version: `* Adds a boundary event`.
