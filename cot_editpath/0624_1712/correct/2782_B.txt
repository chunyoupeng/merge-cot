### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
/**
     * Handle activity results
     * @param requestCode reqCode
     * @param resultCode resCode
     * @param data data
     */
||||||| base

/**
     * Handle activity results

     * @param requestCode reqCode
     * @param resultCode  resCode
     * @param data        data
     */
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the Javadoc comment for a method that handles activity results.
   - In `a`, the Javadoc is written in a single line with minimal spacing and no line breaks.
   - In `b`, the Javadoc is formatted with line breaks and consistent indentation for the parameter descriptions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s version is compact but less readable due to the lack of line breaks and formatting.
   - `b`'s version is more readable and follows standard Java documentation formatting conventions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` likely aimed for brevity and minimalism.
   - `b` aimed for clarity and adherence to standard JavaDoc formatting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b`'s version aligns with standard JavaDoc formatting and improves readability, it should be preferred.
   - The formatting in `b` is more maintainable and consistent with common practices in Java projects.
