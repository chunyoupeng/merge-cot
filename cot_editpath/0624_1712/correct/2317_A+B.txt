### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

@DatabaseChange(name="addColumn", description = "Adds a new column to an existing table", priority = ChangeMetaData.PRIORITY_DEFAULT, appliesTo = "table")

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> Add <WITH> Adds)
<REPLACE> Column <WITH> a)
<ADD> new column to an existing table


## From base to b
<REPLACE> ColumnConfig <WITH> AddColumnConfig)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Changed the `description` from `"Add Column"` to `"Adds a new column to an existing table"`.
     - This is a more detailed and descriptive version of the original.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Changed the generic type from `ColumnConfig` to `AddColumnConfig`.
     - This implies a new configuration class was introduced for this specific use case.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change to the description**:
     - The new description is more verbose and provides context about the purpose of the change.
     - This is likely intended to improve clarity for users or developers reading the code.
   - **Branch b's change to the generic type**:
     - This change introduces a new configuration class, which may be necessary if the logic for adding a column requires specific configuration parameters.
     - It suggests a more modular or specialized design.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The intention is to improve documentation and clarity of the `AddColumnChange` class.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The intention is to specialize the configuration type for the `AddColumnChange` class, likely to support more specific or complex configuration needs.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes.
   - The description change in `a` can be merged without conflict.
   - The generic type change in `b` is also valid and necessary if `AddColumnConfig` is a new class that provides more specific configuration options.
   - Therefore, both changes should be retained in the final merged code.
