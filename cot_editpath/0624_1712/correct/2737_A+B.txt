### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, meaning both `a` and `b` added entirely new content.
   - `a` added two test methods:
     - `itCanDeserMemberJoinedChannelEventWithoutInviter()`: tests deserialization of a Slack event where a member joins a channel without an inviter.
     - `itCanDeserMemberJoinedChannelEventWithInviter()`: tests deserialization of a Slack event where a member joins a channel with an inviter.
   - `b` added one test method:
     - `itCanDeserUserChangeEvent()`: tests deserialization of a Slack user change event, including a check for the user being marked as deleted.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are adding new test cases for different Slack event types.
   - `a` focuses on `MEMBER_JOINED_CHANNEL` events, covering two scenarios (with and without an inviter).
   - `b` focuses on `USER_CHANGE` events, including a specific check for the `isDeleted` flag.
   - These are distinct and non-overlapping features, so both sets of tests are valid and should be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to ensure that the system can correctly deserialize and validate `MEMBER_JOINED_CHANNEL` events in different formats.
   - The intention of `b` is to ensure that the system can correctly deserialize and validate `USER_CHANGE` events, including handling of the `isDeleted` flag.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` are adding new, non-conflicting test cases for different Slack event types, the best resolution is to merge both sets of tests.
   - No code from either branch needs to be discarded or modified.
   - The final result should include all three test methods: the two from `a` and the one from `b`.
