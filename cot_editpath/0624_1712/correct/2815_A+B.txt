### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert .
<ADD> <newline> assertNotNull ( sample . metaDataFactory ) ;


## From base to b
<DELETE> Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert . Assert .
<ADD> <newline> assertNotNull ( sample . bundleProcessor ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, all assertions are prefixed with `Assert.` (e.g., `Assert.assertNotNull(...)`).
   - In branch `a`, the `Assert.` prefix is removed, and a new line `assertNotNull(sample.metaDataFactory);` is added.
   - In branch `b`, the `Assert.` prefix is also removed, and a new line `assertNotNull(sample.bundleProcessor);` is added.
   - The conflict arises because both branches removed the `Assert.` prefix and added a new assertion line, but for different fields (`metaDataFactory` in `a`, `bundleProcessor` in `b`).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches removed the `Assert.` prefix, which suggests a style or refactoring change (e.g., moving to a static import or a different assertion style).
   - The addition of `assertNotNull(sample.metaDataFactory);` in `a` and `assertNotNull(sample.bundleProcessor);` in `b` are both valid and likely represent new validation checks added independently in each branch.
   - The removal of the `Assert.` prefix is consistent in both branches, so it should be preserved.
   - The new assertions should be combined to ensure both `metaDataFactory` and `bundleProcessor` are validated.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both branches appears to be to simplify the assertion syntax (likely via static imports).
   - The addition of new assertions in each branch is likely to ensure that newly introduced or important fields are not null.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Keep the removal of the `Assert.` prefix.
   - Include both new assertions from `a` and `b` to ensure all relevant fields are validated.
   - The resulting code should be concise, consistent, and include all necessary validations.
