### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public class TopChildrenQueryParser extends BaseQueryParserTemp {
||||||| base
public class TopChildrenQueryParser implements QueryParser {
=======
@Deprecated
public class TopChildrenQueryParser implements QueryParser {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> implements <WITH> extends)
<REPLACE> QueryParser <WITH> BaseQueryParserTemp)


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Deprecated <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the class `TopChildrenQueryParser` is defined as implementing the `QueryParser` interface.
   - In `a`, the class is changed to extend `BaseQueryParserTemp` instead of implementing `QueryParser`.
   - In `b`, the class is marked as `@Deprecated` and still implements `QueryParser`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** Changing from `implements` to `extends` suggests a design shift from using an interface to inheriting behavior from a class. This could indicate a refactoring or a new implementation strategy.
   - **Change in `b`:** Adding `@Deprecated` indicates that the class is no longer recommended for use, likely due to being replaced or outdated. This is a common practice to signal deprecation without removing the class immediately.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention in `a`:** The intention is to refactor the class to inherit from a base class (`BaseQueryParserTemp`) rather than implement an interface. This might be part of a broader architectural change.
   - **Intention in `b`:** The intention is to mark the class as deprecated, likely to phase it out in favor of a newer implementation or to signal that it is no longer supported.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The deprecation in `b` is a strong signal that the class is no longer in active use, which aligns with the idea of refactoring in `a` to a new implementation.
   - Since `a` is introducing a new implementation strategy (extending a class), it makes sense to keep that change.
   - The deprecation from `b` should also be retained to maintain the signal that the class is deprecated.
   - Therefore, the class should be marked as deprecated and extend `BaseQueryParserTemp`.
