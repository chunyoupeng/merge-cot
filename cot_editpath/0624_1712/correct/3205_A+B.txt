### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import static io.improbable.keanu.tensor.TensorShapeValidation.checkHasOneNonLengthOneShapeOrAllLengthOne;
||||||| base

=======
@DisplayInformationForOutput(displayName = "-")
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which are based on an empty base.
   - Branch `a` added an import statement: `import static io.improbable.keanu.tensor.TensorShapeValidation.checkHasOneNonLengthOneShapeOrAllLengthOne;`.
   - Branch `b` added an annotation: `@DisplayInformationForOutput(displayName = "-")`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The import in `a` is for a static method used for tensor shape validation. This is likely part of a validation logic implementation.
   - The annotation in `b` is for display purposes, likely used in a UI or logging context to label an output field.
   - Since the base is empty, both changes are entirely new and do not conflict with each other in terms of overlapping code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to include a utility method for tensor shape validation.
   - The intention of `b` is to add metadata for output display, likely for user-facing or debugging purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are independent and serve different purposes.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in the code structure.
   - Therefore, both changes should be retained in the final merged code.
