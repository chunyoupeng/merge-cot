### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@Override
    public String getAuthType() {
||||||| base
public String getAuthType()
    {
=======
@Override
    public String getAuthType()
    {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> @ Override <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Override <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method `getAuthType()` is defined without an `@Override` annotation.
   - In branch `a`, the method is modified by adding the `@Override` annotation and removing a newline before the method.
   - In branch `b`, the method is also modified by adding the `@Override` annotation, but the formatting (newline) is preserved.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` aim to add the `@Override` annotation, which is a good practice for clarity and to ensure the method is intended to override a superclass method.
   - The only difference is in formatting: `a` removes a newline before the method, while `b` keeps it. This is a minor stylistic difference and does not affect functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` is to improve code clarity by adding the `@Override` annotation.
   - The formatting difference is likely due to different code style preferences or auto-formatting settings.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches aim to add the `@Override` annotation, the most logical resolution is to include it.
   - Regarding formatting, the newline before the method is not essential for correctness, but preserving it is a safer and more conservative choice to avoid unnecessary style changes.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include the `@Override` annotation and preserve the newline as in `b`.
