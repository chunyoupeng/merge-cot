### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

@Order(60)
	@ExportEntity(LocationDto.class)
	@ExportProperty({

||||||| base

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ExportEntity ( LocationDto . class ) <newline> @
<REPLACE> EventParticipantExportDto <WITH> {)
<ADD> <newline> EventDto
<REPLACE> EVENT_DISTRICT <WITH> EVENT_LOCATION)
<ADD> , <newline> LocationDto . DISTRICT }


## From base to b
<REPLACE> 60 <WITH> 72)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Added `@ExportEntity(LocationDto.class)`.
     - Replaced `EventParticipantExportDto.EVENT_DISTRICT` with a new `@ExportProperty` that includes `EventDto.EVENT_LOCATION` and `LocationDto.DISTRICT`.
     - This suggests that `a` is trying to export more detailed location information by including both event location and district from the `LocationDto`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Changed the `@Order` from `60` to `72`.
     - This is a minor change that likely affects the order in which this export property is displayed or processed.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes**:
     - The addition of `@ExportEntity` and the new `@ExportProperty` values indicate an intention to enhance the export functionality by including more fields.
     - These changes are likely necessary for a more comprehensive export of location data.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The change in `@Order` is a simple adjustment that may be used to reposition this export property in a list or UI.
     - It is a non-conflicting change that can be applied independently.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is focused on **expanding the data exported**, likely to include more relevant location details.
   - **Branch `b`** is focused on **reordering the export properties**, likely for better user experience or data organization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `a` are more substantial and likely more important for the functionality of the export.
   - The change in `b` (changing the order) can be applied on top of `a`'s changes without conflict.
   - Therefore, we will **keep the changes from `a`**, and **apply the order change from `b`** to the result.
   - This ensures that the enhanced export functionality is preserved, and the order is adjusted as intended.
