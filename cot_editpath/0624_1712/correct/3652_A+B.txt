### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import org.niis.xroad.restapi.openapi.model.Subject;
import org.niis.xroad.restapi.openapi.model.SubjectType;
||||||| base

=======
import org.niis.xroad.restapi.service.CertificateNotFoundException;
import org.niis.xroad.restapi.service.ClientNotFoundException;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - `a` added two import statements:
     - `import org.niis.xroad.restapi.openapi.model.Subject;`
     - `import org.niis.xroad.restapi.openapi.model.SubjectType;`
   - `b` added two different import statements:
     - `import org.niis.xroad.restapi.service.CertificateNotFoundException;`
     - `import org.niis.xroad.restapi.service.ClientNotFoundException;`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are adding necessary imports for their respective code changes.
   - `a` is likely working with models related to subjects and subject types, possibly for API modeling or data structures.
   - `b` is likely working with service layer exceptions, indicating it is handling error cases in service logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to support functionality involving subject models.
   - The intention of `b` is to support error handling in service methods.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of imports are necessary for their respective functionalities and do not conflict with each other, the best resolution is to include all four import statements.
   - This ensures that both branches' functionalities are preserved without any loss.
   - The order of the imports can be maintained as per the original order in each branch, or sorted alphabetically for consistency.
