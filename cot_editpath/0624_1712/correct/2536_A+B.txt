### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
double smallestCostToGoal = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
||||||| base

=======
if (!initialStanceFootWasSet || !goalWasSet)
      {         
         return FootstepPlanningResult.NO_PATH_EXISTS;
      }

      initialize();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs at the point where the code from branch `a` introduces a new variable `double smallestCostToGoal = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;`.
   - Branch `b` introduces a block of code that checks if `initialStanceFootWasSet` and `goalWasSet` are true, and if not, returns `FootstepPlanningResult.NO_PATH_EXISTS`. It also calls `initialize()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Introduces a variable `smallestCostToGoal` initialized to `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. This likely represents a value used in some cost-based planning logic, possibly for tracking the minimum cost to reach a goal.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Introduces a conditional check to ensure that the planning process has valid initial and goal states before proceeding. This is a defensive programming practice to avoid invalid planning attempts.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To add a variable for tracking cost in the planning logic. This suggests the planning logic is being enhanced to include cost-based optimization.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To add a precondition check to ensure the planning process is only executed when valid inputs are available. This improves robustness and correctness.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are logically independent and serve different purposes. The variable from `a` is likely used in the planning logic and should be retained.
   - The conditional check from `b` ensures the planning logic is only executed when valid inputs are available, which is a good practice and should also be retained.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both changes, with the variable from `a` placed before the conditional logic from `b` to ensure it is properly initialized before use.

```java
double smallestCostToGoal = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;

if (!initialStanceFootWasSet || !goalWasSet)
{         
   return FootstepPlanningResult.NO_PATH_EXISTS;
}

initialize();
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
double smallestCostToGoal = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;

      if (!initialStanceFootWasSet || !goalWasSet)
      {         
         return FootstepPlanningResult.NO_PATH_EXISTS;
      }

      initialize();
