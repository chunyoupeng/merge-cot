### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
bps = getBorderProps(bordProps, CommonBorderPaddingBackground.AFTER, context);
||||||| base
bps = getBorderProps(bordProps, CommonBorderPaddingBackground.AFTER);
=======
bps = getBorderProps(borderProps, CommonBorderPaddingBackground.AFTER);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , context


## From base to b
<REPLACE> bordProps <WITH> borderProps)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:  
     `bps = getBorderProps(bordProps, CommonBorderPaddingBackground.AFTER);`
   - In branch `a`, the line is:  
     `bps = getBorderProps(bordProps, CommonBorderPaddingBackground.AFTER, context);`  
     This adds a new parameter `, context` to the method call.
   - In branch `b`, the line is:  
     `bps = getBorderProps(borderProps, CommonBorderPaddingBackground.AFTER);`  
     This renames `bordProps` to `borderProps`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `, context` suggests that the method `getBorderProps` now requires an additional context parameter. This is likely due to an updated method signature in the codebase.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Renaming `bordProps` to `borderProps` is a variable name correction. It's likely a typo fix or a naming standard enforcement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To update the method call to match a new method signature that includes a `context` parameter.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To fix a variable name typo or align with a naming convention (e.g., camelCase).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes: one is a method signature update, the other is a variable name correction.
   - The correct resolution is to combine both changes: use the corrected variable name `borderProps` and include the new `context` parameter.
   - This ensures the code is both syntactically correct and semantically aligned with the updated method definition.
