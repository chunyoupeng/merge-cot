### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Introduced a new `RestClient.Builder` instance.
     - Replaced `applyCredentialsFilter(serviceClient.clientBuilder)` with `.withInterceptor(...)`.
     - Removed the `serviceClient.getClientInterceptors().add(...)` line.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Also introduced a new `RestClient.Builder` instance.
     - Replaced `applyCredentialsFilter` with `.withMapperAdapter(new JacksonMapperAdapter())`.
     - Replaced `credentials.applyCredentialsFilter(...)` with `.withCredentials(credentials)`.
     - Added `.withInterceptor(...)`.

   The conflict centers around the configuration of the `RestClient.Builder`. Both branches aim to replace the old way of applying credentials and interceptors with a new builder pattern, but they differ in the order and specific methods used.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Introduces a new builder pattern and removes the old `applyCredentialsFilter` and `add` methods.
     - Uses `.withCredentials(credentials)` and `.withInterceptor(...)`.
     - This is a clean and modern approach, but it skips the `.withMapperAdapter(...)` step.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Also introduces a new builder pattern.
     - Adds `.withMapperAdapter(new JacksonMapperAdapter())` before `.withCredentials(...)` and `.withInterceptor(...)`.
     - This suggests a more complete configuration of the builder, including a mapper adapter.

   The `.withMapperAdapter(...)` is a meaningful addition that should be preserved if the application relies on custom serialization/deserialization.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to modernize the code by replacing the old `applyCredentialsFilter` and `add` methods with a cleaner builder pattern.
   - **Branch `b`** also modernizes the code but includes an additional step for the mapper adapter, which is important for data serialization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best resolution is to combine the intentions of both branches.
   - Start with `.withMapperAdapter(...)` as in branch `b` to ensure proper serialization.
   - Then apply `.withCredentials(...)` and `.withInterceptor(...)` as in branch `a` to configure credentials and interceptors.
   - This results in a complete and modernized configuration of the `RestClient.Builder`.

```java
RestClient.Builder restBuilder = new RestClient.Builder("http://localhost", clientBuilder, retrofitBuilder)
                .withMapperAdapter(new JacksonMapperAdapter())
                .withCredentials(credentials)
                .withInterceptor(new Interceptor() {
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
RestClient.Builder restBuilder = new RestClient.Builder("http://localhost", clientBuilder, retrofitBuilder)
                .withMapperAdapter(new JacksonMapperAdapter())
                .withCredentials(credentials)
                .withInterceptor(new Interceptor() {
