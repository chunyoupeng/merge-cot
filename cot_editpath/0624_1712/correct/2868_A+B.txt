### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
List<ContactExportDto> getExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max, Language userLanguage);
||||||| base
List<ContactExportDto> getExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max);

	List<ContactVisitsExportDto> getContactVisitsExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max);

	long countMaximumFollowUps(ContactCriteria contactCriteria);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , Language userLanguage


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> List < ContactVisitsExportDto > getContactVisitsExportList ( ContactCriteria contactCriteria , int first , int max ) ; <newline> <newline> long countMaximumFollowUps ( ContactCriteria contactCriteria ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a parameter `Language userLanguage` to the method `getExportList`.
   - **Branch `b`** added two new methods:
     - `getContactVisitsExportList`, which returns a list of `ContactVisitsExportDto`.
     - `countMaximumFollowUps`, which returns a `long` count based on `ContactCriteria`.
   - The conflict arises because both branches modified the same method declaration (`getExportList`) in different ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a `userLanguage` parameter to the `getExportList` method. This likely indicates that the export logic should be language-dependent, such as for localization or formatting.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** adds two new methods, which are unrelated to the `getExportList` method but are likely part of extending the export functionality to include contact visits and follow-up counts.
   - The two changes are orthogonal: one modifies an existing method, the other adds new methods.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to enhance the `getExportList` method to support language-specific exports.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to expand the export capabilities by introducing new methods for contact visits and follow-up counts.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the changes are orthogonal, we can safely merge both changes.
   - The `getExportList` method should include the `userLanguage` parameter from branch `a`.
   - The two new methods from branch `b` should be added as-is.
   - The resolution should reflect both sets of changes without conflict.

```java
List<ContactExportDto> getExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max, Language userLanguage);

List<ContactVisitsExportDto> getContactVisitsExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max);

long countMaximumFollowUps(ContactCriteria contactCriteria);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
List<ContactExportDto> getExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max, Language userLanguage);

	List<ContactVisitsExportDto> getContactVisitsExportList(ContactCriteria contactCriteria, int first, int max);

	long countMaximumFollowUps(ContactCriteria contactCriteria);
