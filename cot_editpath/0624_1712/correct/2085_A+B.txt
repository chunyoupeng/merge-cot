### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
showError("Invalid date range: \"From\" date must be before \"To\" date.", "Export configuration error");
        endDatePicker.clear();
||||||| base
showError("Invalid date range: \"From\" date must be before \"To\" date.", "Export configuration error");
        endDateField.clear();
=======
showError(MessageStrings.INVALID_DATE_RANGE_MESSAGE, "Export configuration error");
        endDateField.clear();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> endDateField <WITH> endDatePicker)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> " <WITH> MessageStrings)
<DELETE> Invalid date range : \ " From \ " date must be before \ " To \ " date
<REPLACE> " <WITH> INVALID_DATE_RANGE_MESSAGE)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the code uses `endDateField.clear()` and a hardcoded error message: `"Invalid date range: \"From\" date must be before \"To\" date."`.
   - In `a`, the code replaces `endDateField` with `endDatePicker`, but keeps the hardcoded error message.
   - In `b`, the code replaces the hardcoded message with a reference to `MessageStrings.INVALID_DATE_RANGE_MESSAGE` and keeps `endDateField.clear()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s change from `endDateField` to `endDatePicker` likely reflects a UI component update (e.g., replacing a text field with a date picker).
   - `b`'s change to use a message constant (`MessageStrings.INVALID_DATE_RANGE_MESSAGE`) is a good practice for internationalization and maintainability.
   - The hardcoded message in `a` is less maintainable and not ideal for localization.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a`'s intention is to update the UI component to a date picker, which is a UI/UX improvement.
   - `b`'s intention is to improve code maintainability and support for localization by using a message constant.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and complementary. The UI component should be updated to `endDatePicker` (from `a`), and the hardcoded message should be replaced with the constant (from `b`).
   - The final code should reflect both improvements for correctness and maintainability.
