### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> javax <WITH> jakarta)


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the package name from `javax.servlet-api-4` to `jakarta.servlet-api-4`. This is a common change when migrating from Java EE to Jakarta EE, where the package name was updated from `javax` to `jakarta`.
   - **Branch `b`** did not change the package name. Instead, it removed three newlines and added one newline. This is a formatting change and does not affect the logic of the code.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in **branch `a`** is meaningful and reflects a real update in the dependency, likely due to a migration to Jakarta EE. This change should be preserved.
   - The change in **branch `b`** is purely cosmetic and does not alter the behavior of the code. It can be safely ignored or merged without conflict.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to update the test to reflect a new dependency version with a different package name (`jakarta` instead of `javax`).
   - **Branch `b`** aims to clean up the formatting of the test code, likely for readability or to align with a code style guideline.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the change in `a` is semantically meaningful and the change in `b` is only cosmetic, the correct resolution is to keep the `jakarta` version from `a` and preserve the formatting from `b` (or use the formatting from `a` if it's more readable).
   - The formatting in `a` is already clean and readable, so we will adopt it in the final resolution.
