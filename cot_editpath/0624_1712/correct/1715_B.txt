### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> +
<DELETE> +
<ADD> +
<DELETE> +
<ADD> +
<DELETE> + <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# CoT

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the `throw new AxonAssertionError(...)` line.
   - In `base`, the string is concatenated using `+` and line breaks are handled with `\n`.
   - In `a`, the string is concatenated using `+` and includes an extra `+` before the `\n`, which is likely a formatting mistake.
   - In `b`, the string is concatenated using `+` and line breaks are handled with `\n`, similar to `base`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` added an extra `+` before the `\n`, which is incorrect and will cause a compilation error.
   - `b` kept the original structure of the string, maintaining correctness and readability.
   - The intention of `a` seems to be to improve formatting, but the implementation is flawed.
   - The intention of `b` seems to be to preserve the original logic and formatting.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` likely intended to improve the formatting of the error message but made a mistake in the string concatenation.
   - `b` likely intended to maintain the original behavior and formatting, ensuring the code remains correct and readable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The correct and readable version is from `b`, as it maintains the original structure and avoids the compilation error introduced by `a`.
   - The extra `+` in `a` is a mistake and should be discarded.
   - The resolution should use the version from `b` to ensure correctness and maintainability.

# Final Resolution

```java
throw new AxonAssertionError(format("Illegal state change detected! "
                            + "Property \"%s\" has different value when sourcing events.\n"
                            + "Working aggregate value:     <%s>\n"
                            + "Value after applying events: <%s>",
                    propertyPath, workingValue, eventSourcedValue));
        } else if (workingValue != null && comparedEntries.add(new ComparationEntry(workingValue, eventSourcedValue))
                && !hasEqualsMethod(workingValue.getClass())) {
