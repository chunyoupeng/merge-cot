### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
providersImplMap.put(Constants.GOOGLE_PLUS,
				org.brickred.socialauth.provider.GooglePlusImpl.class);
||||||| base

=======
providersImplMap.put(Constants.INSTAGRAM,
				org.brickred.socialauth.provider.RunkeeperImpl.class);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a single line of code where both branches `a` and `b` have inserted their own version of a `providersImplMap.put(...)` statement.
   - In branch `a`, the key is `Constants.GOOGLE_PLUS` and the value is `org.brickred.socialauth.provider.GooglePlusImpl.class`.
   - In branch `b`, the key is `Constants.INSTAGRAM` and the value is `org.brickred.socialauth.provider.RunkeeperImpl.class`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are adding new entries to the `providersImplMap`, which is a map of social media providers to their respective implementation classes.
   - The changes are not conflicting in terms of overwriting the same key; they are adding different keys and values.
   - Since the base is empty, both branches are independently adding their own entries.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of branch `a` is to add support for Google Plus by registering its implementation class.
   - The intention of branch `b` is to add support for Instagram by registering the Runkeeper implementation class (note: this may be a mistake, as Runkeeper is not Instagram, but it's what was added in branch `b`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding new entries to the map and not modifying the same key, both changes should be retained.
   - The Runkeeper implementation being associated with Instagram in branch `b` is likely an error, but since that is the change made, it should be preserved unless corrected.
   - Therefore, the resolution is to merge both lines into the final code.

```java
providersImplMap.put(Constants.GOOGLE_PLUS,
		org.brickred.socialauth.provider.GooglePlusImpl.class);
providersImplMap.put(Constants.INSTAGRAM,
		org.brickred.socialauth.provider.RunkeeperImpl.class);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
providersImplMap.put(Constants.GOOGLE_PLUS,
				org.brickred.socialauth.provider.GooglePlusImpl.class);
		providersImplMap.put(Constants.INSTAGRAM,
				org.brickred.socialauth.provider.RunkeeperImpl.class);
