### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (SystemVariables.getSysVars().getDefaultValue(key) == null) {
||||||| base
if (SystemVariables.getDefaultValue(key) == null) {
=======
if (key.startsWith("@@")) {
                    key = key.substring(2);
                }
                if (SystemVariables.getDefaultValue(key) == null) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> . getSysVars ( )


## From base to b
<ADD> if ( key . startsWith ( " @ @ " ) ) { <newline> key = key . substring ( 2 ) ; <newline> } <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the condition is: `if (SystemVariables.getDefaultValue(key) == null) {`.
   - In branch `a`, the change is: `SystemVariables.getSysVars().getDefaultValue(key)`, which adds a call to `getSysVars()` before calling `getDefaultValue(key)`.
   - In branch `b`, the change is adding a new block of code before the original condition:
     ```java
     if (key.startsWith("@@")) {
         key = key.substring(2);
     }
     ```
     This modifies the `key` variable if it starts with `@@`, then proceeds with the original condition.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** It introduces a method call to `getSysVars()` before calling `getDefaultValue(key)`. This suggests that `getDefaultValue` is now a method of an object returned by `getSysVars()`, rather than a static method. This is likely a structural change in the codebase, possibly to encapsulate system variables better.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** It adds a preprocessing step to the `key` variable. This implies that keys with the prefix `@@` should be treated differently, and the prefix should be stripped before checking the default value. This is a logical change that modifies the behavior of the key lookup.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To update the code to use a new structure where `getDefaultValue` is accessed via an instance method of `SystemVariables.getSysVars()`. This is likely a refactor to improve modularity or encapsulation.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To handle keys with the `@@` prefix by stripping it before checking for a default value. This is a feature or bug fix that changes the behavior of the key lookup logic.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The change in `a` is structural and should be preserved to reflect the new API usage.
   - The change in `b` is functional and should also be preserved to handle the `@@` prefix correctly.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both changes: first, process the key by stripping the `@@` prefix if present, and then use the updated method call to `getSysVars().getDefaultValue(key)`.

```java
if (key.startsWith("@@")) {
    key = key.substring(2);
}
if (SystemVariables.getSysVars().getDefaultValue(key) == null) {
```

if (key.startsWith("@@")) {
                    key = key.substring(2);
                }
                if (SystemVariables.getSysVars().getDefaultValue(key) == null) {
