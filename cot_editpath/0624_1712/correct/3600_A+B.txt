### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public void addInformation(ItemStack stack, World world, List<String> tooltip, ITooltipFlag flag) {
        FullFacadeInstance states = getStates(stack);
||||||| base
public void addInformation(ItemStack stack, EntityPlayer player, List<String> tooltip, boolean advanced) {
        FullFacadeInstance states = getStates(stack);
=======
public void addInformation(ItemStack stack, EntityPlayer player, List<String> tooltip, boolean advanced) {
        FacadeInstance states = getStates(stack);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> EntityPlayer <WITH> World)
<REPLACE> player <WITH> world)
<REPLACE> boolean <WITH> ITooltipFlag)
<REPLACE> advanced <WITH> flag)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> FullFacadeInstance <WITH> FacadeInstance)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Changed the method signature from:
       `addInformation(ItemStack stack, EntityPlayer player, List<String> tooltip, boolean advanced)`
       to:
       `addInformation(ItemStack stack, World world, List<String> tooltip, ITooltipFlag flag)`
     - Replaced `EntityPlayer player` with `World world`.
     - Replaced `boolean advanced` with `ITooltipFlag flag`.
     - Changed the type of `states` from `FullFacadeInstance` to `FullFacadeInstance` (no change).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Changed the method signature from:
       `addInformation(ItemStack stack, EntityPlayer player, List<String> tooltip, boolean advanced)`
       to:
       `addInformation(ItemStack stack, EntityPlayer player, List<String> tooltip, boolean advanced)`
     - Changed the type of `states` from `FullFacadeInstance` to `FacadeInstance`.

   - The conflict occurs in the method signature and the type of `states`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes:**
     - The method signature change reflects a shift from using `EntityPlayer` and `boolean` to `World` and `ITooltipFlag`. This is likely to align with a newer API or a different design pattern where the tooltip logic depends on the world context and a more complex flag object.
     - The `FullFacadeInstance` type remains unchanged, suggesting that the logic for retrieving `states` is still compatible with the new method signature.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes:**
     - The method signature remains the same, but the type of `states` is changed from `FullFacadeInstance` to `FacadeInstance`. This suggests a simplification or a different abstraction level of the facade logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to modernize or adapt the method to a new API or framework, where the tooltip depends on the world context and a more complex flag object.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to simplify or refactor the facade logic, using a less detailed version of the facade instance.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method signature from `a` is more modern and likely better aligned with current practices or newer APIs.
   - The `FacadeInstance` from `b` is a simplified version of the facade logic, which may be more appropriate for the current context.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to adopt the method signature from `a` and the `FacadeInstance` type from `b`, combining both changes to reflect the most up-to-date and appropriate implementation.
