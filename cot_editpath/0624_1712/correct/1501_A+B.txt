### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
void deleteIdentityLinksByProcessInstanceId(String processInstanceId);
||||||| base

=======
void deleteIdentityLinksByScopeIdAndScopeType(String scopeId, String scopeType);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two method declarations:
     - `a` introduces: `void deleteIdentityLinksByProcessInstanceId(String processInstanceId);`
     - `b` introduces: `void deleteIdentityLinksByScopeIdAndScopeType(String scopeId, String scopeType);`
   - The base is empty, so both `a` and `b` are adding new methods independently.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` adds a method to delete identity links by `processInstanceId`, which is a common use case in workflow or BPM systems.
   - `b` adds a method to delete identity links by `scopeId` and `scopeType`, which is more flexible and can generalize the deletion logic beyond just process instances.
   - Both methods are valid and serve different purposes. Neither should be discarded outright.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a specific, straightforward way to delete identity links tied to a process instance.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide a more generalized method that can handle different types of scopes (e.g., process instance, task, case, etc.).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both methods are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to **keep both methods**.
   - This preserves the flexibility and specificity of both implementations.
   - No code style or correctness issues are present, and both methods are logically sound.
