### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> <newline> private VideoContent ( ) { <newline> <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> PREMIUM_VIDEO_URL = <newline> " http : / / video . wikia . com / wiki / File : Batman_ - _Following " ; <newline> public static final String PREMIUM_VIDEO_NAME = " Batman - Following " ; <newline> <newline> public static final String <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a private constructor `private VideoContent() { }` after the `PREMIUM_VIDEO_NAME2` declaration.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new constant `PREMIUM_VIDEO_URL` and `PREMIUM_VIDEO_NAME` for a new video ("Batman - Following") before `PREMIUM_VIDEO_URL2`. It also reformatted the code with line breaks and spacing for `PREMIUM_VIDEO_URL2` and `PREMIUM_VIDEO_NAME2`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding a private constructor is a common pattern in utility classes to prevent instantiation. This is a valid and useful addition if `VideoContent` is intended to be a utility class.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding a new video entry is a logical extension of the existing pattern. The reformatting of the existing constants is primarily a style change and doesn't affect functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To make the class non-instantiable, likely to enforce it being a utility class.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To add a new premium video entry and improve code formatting for readability.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The private constructor from `a` should be retained to enforce the class as a utility class.
   - The new video entry from `b` should be added to expand the list of premium videos.
   - The formatting from `b` can be adopted to maintain consistency in the code style.
   - The final code should include both the new video and the private constructor, with consistent formatting.
