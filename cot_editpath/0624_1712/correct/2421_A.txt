### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private static <T> DoubleProperty getLowerBoundProperty( Axis<T> axis ) {
||||||| base
private <T> DoubleProperty getLowerBoundProperty(Axis<T> axis) {
=======
private static <T> DoubleProperty getLowerBoundProperty(Axis<T> axis) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> static


## From base to b
<ADD> static


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**  
   - The conflict is in the method declaration `getLowerBoundProperty(Axis<T> axis)`.  
   - Both `a` and `b` added the keyword `static` to the method declaration.  
   - The base version of the method does **not** have the `static` keyword.  

2. **Evaluate each change:**  
   - Both `a` and `b` independently added the `static` modifier, which suggests a shared intention to make the method static.  
   - The `static` keyword is valid in this context and does not conflict in meaning between the two branches.  
   - There is no functional or semantic conflict between the two changes.  

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**  
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` appears to be to make the method `getLowerBoundProperty` static, likely to allow it to be called without an instance of the class.  
   - This is a common refactoring when the method does not rely on instance state.  

4. **Final decision:**  
   - Since both branches independently added the `static` keyword, the correct resolution is to keep the `static` modifier.  
   - The method should be declared as `private static <T> DoubleProperty getLowerBoundProperty(Axis<T> axis)`.  
   - This aligns with both branches' intentions and maintains correctness and consistency in the code.
