### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Collection<EmailAttachment> getAttachments();
||||||| base
//FIXME Release 0.4.0 will fix this bug to have Collection<EmailAttachment>
    Collection<EmailAttachmentImpl> getAttachments();

//FIXME Release 0.4.0 will fix this bug to have Collection<EmailAttachment>
    default @NonNull Collection<EmailAttachmentImpl> getAttachments() {
        return ImmutableList.of();
    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> / / FIXME Release 0 . 4 . 0 will fix this bug to have > <newline> Collection < EmailAttachmentImpl


## From base to b
<ADD> default @ NonNull { <newline> return ImmutableList . of ( ) <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the `FIXME` comment and changed the return type from `Collection<EmailAttachmentImpl>` to `Collection<EmailAttachment>`. This suggests an intention to generalize the method's return type to an interface instead of a concrete implementation.
   - **Branch `b`** added a `default` method implementation with `@NonNull` and returns an empty immutable list. This suggests an intention to provide a default behavior for the method, likely for backward compatibility or to make the interface more usable without forcing implementers to define the method.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is about improving the abstraction by returning an interface type (`EmailAttachment`) instead of a concrete class (`EmailAttachmentImpl`). This is a good design practice and makes the API more flexible.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces a default implementation, which is a valid and modern Java 8+ feature. It also adds a non-null guarantee via `@NonNull`, which is helpful for static analysis and code clarity.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve the API design by abstracting the return type.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to improve usability by providing a default implementation and ensuring non-null return values.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best resolution is to **combine both changes**. The method should return `Collection<EmailAttachment>` (from `a`) and include the default implementation (from `b`). This way, the API is both flexible and usable.
   - The `@NonNull` annotation should be retained to ensure the method returns a non-null value.
   - The `FIXME` comment can be removed since the change in `a` already addresses the issue it was pointing out.
