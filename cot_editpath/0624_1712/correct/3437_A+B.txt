### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
final List<Observation<?>> observations;
||||||| base
final List<AbstractObservation> observations;
=======
final List<AbstractObservation> observations;
                String procedure = resultTemplates.get(0).getProcedure().getIdentifier();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> AbstractObservation <WITH> Observation)
<ADD> < ? >


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> String procedure = resultTemplates . get ( 0 ) . getProcedure ( ) . getIdentifier ( ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the variable is declared as `final List<AbstractObservation> observations;`.
   - In branch `a`, the type is changed to `final List<Observation<?>> observations;`. This suggests that `Observation` is a subclass or a generic version of `AbstractObservation`, and the wildcard `<?>` indicates that the list can hold any type of `Observation`.
   - In branch `b`, the code adds a new line: `String procedure = resultTemplates.get(0).getProcedure().getIdentifier();`. This line is unrelated to the type change in `a`, but it introduces a new variable and logic.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` is a type substitution from `AbstractObservation` to `Observation<?>`. This could be to allow more flexibility in the types of observations stored in the list, or to enforce a more specific type constraint.
   - The change in `b` introduces a new line of logic that retrieves a procedure identifier from the first element of `resultTemplates`. This is a functional addition and does not conflict with the type change in `a` directly, but it introduces a new line of code that needs to be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` seems to be to refine the type of the `observations` list to a more specific or generic version of `AbstractObservation`.
   - The intention in `b` is to add a new variable and logic for retrieving a procedure identifier, likely for use in some downstream logic.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The type change in `a` and the new line in `b` are orthogonal changes. The type change in `a` should be preserved if `Observation<?>` is the correct type for the list. The new line in `b` should also be preserved as it introduces new functionality.
   - Therefore, the resolution should combine both changes: use the type from `a` and include the new line from `b`.
