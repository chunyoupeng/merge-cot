### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

2, 2, parameters.getDescriptor()), parameters, Collections.<ParameterRole, ParameterDescriptor<Double>>emptyMap(), (byte) 0));

2, 2, parameters.getDescriptor()), parameters, Collections.emptyMap(), (byte) 0));
        super.computeCoefficients();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> < ParameterRole , ParameterDescriptor < Double > >


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> super . computeCoefficients ( ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the line where `Collections.emptyMap()` is used.
   - **Branch a** changes `Collections.emptyMap()` to `Collections.<ParameterRole, ParameterDescriptor<Double>>emptyMap()`, adding a type parameter to make the generic type explicit.
   - **Branch b** adds a new line `super.computeCoefficients();` after the same line.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change:** This is a type-safe enhancement. By explicitly specifying the generic type, it improves code clarity and avoids potential issues with raw types or unchecked casts. This is a common Java best practice, especially in older versions where type inference was less robust.
   - **Branch b's change:** This introduces a call to `super.computeCoefficients();`, which suggests that the method `computeCoefficients()` is overridden in the current class and that the superclass implementation should be invoked. This is a logical and valid addition if the class is extending a superclass that defines this method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To improve type safety and clarity by explicitly specifying the generic type of the empty map.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To ensure that the superclass method is called, likely to maintain the correct behavior of the overridden method.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The type parameter from **a** should be retained for better type safety.
   - The method call from **b** should also be retained to ensure the superclass logic is executed.
   - The resolution should include both changes, with the method call added after the line with the updated map.

# Final Resolution
```java
2, 2, parameters.getDescriptor()), parameters, Collections.<ParameterRole, ParameterDescriptor<Double>>emptyMap(), (byte) 0));
        super.computeCoefficients();
