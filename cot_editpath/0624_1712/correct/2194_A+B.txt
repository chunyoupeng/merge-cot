### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.google.common.collect.Sets;
||||||| base

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> example <WITH> com)
<REPLACE> Child <WITH> fasterxml)
<ADD> . jackson . databind . JsonNode
<REPLACE> example <WITH> com)
<REPLACE> FunWithPermissions <WITH> google)
<ADD> . common . collect . Sets
<DELETE> <newline> import example . Parent ; <newline> import example . User ;


## From base to b
<ADD> Invoice ; <newline> import example . LineItem ; <newline> import example .


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

# CoT

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Replaced `example` with `com` in the package name.
     - Replaced `Child` with `fasterxml` and added `jackson.databind.JsonNode`.
     - Replaced `FunWithPermissions` with `google` and added `common.collect.Sets`.
     - Removed imports for `Parent` and `User`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Added imports for `Invoice` and `LineItem`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The changes in branch a seem to be a wholesale replacement of the `example` package with `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind` and `com.google.common.collect`. This suggests a refactoring to use Jackson and Guava libraries.
     - Removing `Parent` and `User` imports might be part of removing unused code or refactoring the class to no longer use those types.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Adding `Invoice` and `LineItem` imports suggests that the class is now using these types, likely for business logic related to invoices and line items.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The intention appears to be to refactor the code to use Jackson for JSON processing and Guava for collections.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The intention appears to be to add functionality related to invoices and line items.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in branch a and branch b are orthogonal: one is about library refactoring and the other is about adding new business logic.
   - Therefore, both sets of changes should be merged.
   - The imports from both branches should be combined to include all necessary imports.

import com.google.common.collect.Sets;
import example.Child;
import example.FunWithPermissions;
import example.Invoice;
import example.LineItem;
import example.Parent;
import example.User;
```
