### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private void initErrorsGrid() {
        errorsGrid.setTooltip("Click on the rows to see the error details.");
||||||| base
private void initErrorsGrid() {        
        errorsGrid.setTooltip("Click on the rows to see the error details.");
=======
private void initErrorsGrid() {        
        errorsGrid.setTooltip(MSG.view_summaryOverview_tooltip_detectedErrors());
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<REPLACE> " <WITH> MSG)
<DELETE> Click on the rows to see the error details
<REPLACE> " <WITH> view_summaryOverview_tooltip_detectedErrors)
<ADD> ( )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method `initErrorsGrid()` sets a tooltip with the message: `"Click on the rows to see the error details."`.
   - In branch `a`, the code is unchanged from the base.
   - In branch `b`, the tooltip message is replaced with a call to a message resource: `MSG.view_summaryOverview_tooltip_detectedErrors()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` has no changes from the base, so it is not introducing any new logic.
   - Branch `b` is replacing a hard-coded string with a localized message using a message resource (`MSG`). This is a common and recommended practice in internationalized applications to support multiple languages and maintain consistency in UI text.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to maintain the current behavior and UI message.
   - The intention of `b` is to improve the application by making the tooltip message localizable, which is a best practice for multi-language support.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the intention of `b` is to improve the code by making it more maintainable and internationalization-friendly, the change should be kept.
   - The hard-coded string in `a` is not necessary if the application already supports localization.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the change from branch `b`.
