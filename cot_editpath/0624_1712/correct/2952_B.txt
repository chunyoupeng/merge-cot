### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@RequestBody @Validated(ScimUser.NewUserValidation.class) ScimUser user,
      BindingResult validationResult) {
||||||| base
@RequestBody @Validated(ScimUser.NewUserValidation.class) ScimUser user,
    BindingResult validationResult) {
=======
@RequestBody @Validated(ScimUser.NewUserValidation.class) final ScimUser user,
      final BindingResult validationResult) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> final final


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the method signature where the parameters `ScimUser user` and `BindingResult validationResult` are declared.
   - **Branch a** has not made any changes to the parameter declarations compared to the base.
   - **Branch b** has added the `final` keyword to both parameters.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** made no changes, so its version is identical to the base.
   - **Branch b** added `final` to both parameters. This is a common Java best practice to prevent accidental reassignment of method parameters, which can improve code readability and reduce bugs.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely did not change anything because it was focused on other parts of the code or the method logic.
   - **Branch b** aimed to improve code quality and safety by making the parameters `final`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The addition of the `final` keyword in branch b is a safe and beneficial change that aligns with good Java practices.
   - There is no conflict in the logic or behavior between the two branches.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the `final` keyword from branch b.
