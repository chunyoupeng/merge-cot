### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which added new static final lists to the code. However, they added different types of lists:
     - **Branch `a`** added:
       - `GENERAL_IMAGE_TYPE_LIST` (List<ImageType>)
       - `GENERAL_WINDOW_TYPE_CAPABILITIES_LIST` (List<WindowTypeCapabilities>)
       - `GENERAL_WINDOW_CAPABILITY_LIST` (List<WindowCapability>)
       - `GENERAL_DISPLAYCAPABILITY_LIST` (List<DisplayCapability>)
     - **Branch `b`** added:
       - `GENERAL_MENU_LAYOUT_LIST` (List<MenuLayout>)
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding entirely new content.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a set of lists related to image types and window capabilities. These seem to be part of a UI or display system, possibly for managing different types of images and window behaviors.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces a list of menu layouts, which is likely for managing UI layout options in a menu system.
   - Both sets of changes appear to be valid and serve different purposes. There is no overlap in the types or the functionality they represent.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely focused on defining constants for image and window-related capabilities, possibly for a rendering or UI framework.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely focused on defining constants for menu layout options, which could be part of a configuration or UI layout system.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding distinct and non-conflicting constants, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of changes**.
   - This preserves the functionality and intent of both branches without any loss or duplication.
   - The code style is consistent (static final lists with similar naming conventions), so merging them will not introduce any style issues.
   - No business logic conflicts exist, as the constants are unrelated.
