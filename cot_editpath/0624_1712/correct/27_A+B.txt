### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a

## From base to b
<ADD> @ Override <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Adds a new method `register` with parameters and exception handling.
     - Modifies the `start` method to include parameters `ObjectContainer container` and `ClientContext context`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Adds the `@Override` annotation to the `start` method.
     - Does not modify the method body or parameters.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Introduces a new method `register` which is logically separate from the `start` method and does not conflict with `b`'s changes.
     - Modifies the `start` method to accept parameters, which could be necessary for new functionality.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Adds the `@Override` annotation, which is a good practice for clarity and to ensure the method is intended to override a superclass method.
     - Does not change the method signature or body, so it is compatible with the parameter changes from `a`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Intends to add a new method `register` for registration logic.
     - Intends to enhance the `start` method with additional parameters to support new functionality.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Intends to improve code clarity by adding the `@Override` annotation, indicating that the method is meant to override a method from a superclass.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@Override` annotation from `b` should be included in the `start` method to maintain clarity and correctness.
   - The parameter changes from `a` should be retained to support the new functionality.
   - The new `register` method from `a` is logically separate and should be included as is.
   - The conflict is resolved by combining both changes: adding the `@Override` annotation and the new parameters to the `start` method, and including the new `register` method.
