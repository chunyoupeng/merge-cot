### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
ObjectMapper mapper = jsonMapperBuilder()
                .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
||||||| base
ObjectMapper m = JsonMapper.builder()
                .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
=======
ObjectMapper m = JsonMapper.builder()
                .activateDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> m <WITH> mapper)
<REPLACE> JsonMapper <WITH> jsonMapperBuilder)
<DELETE> . builder


## From base to b
<REPLACE> enableDefaultTyping <WITH> activateDefaultTyping)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     ObjectMapper m = JsonMapper.builder()
             .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the changes are:
     - The variable name `m` is changed to `mapper`.
     - `JsonMapper.builder()` is changed to `jsonMapperBuilder()`.
     - The `.builder()` call is removed (likely a typo or redundant).
   - In branch `b`, the change is:
     - `enableDefaultTyping` is replaced with `activateDefaultTyping`.

   The conflict occurs in the line where the `ObjectMapper` is initialized and configured.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - Renaming `m` to `mapper` improves readability and clarity.
     - Replacing `JsonMapper.builder()` with `jsonMapperBuilder()` suggests a refactoring or a change in API usage.
     - Removing `.builder()` is likely a typo or redundant call.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Replacing `enableDefaultTyping` with `activateDefaultTyping` suggests a change in the method name due to API evolution or a bug fix.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to modernize or refactor the code to use a new or cleaner API (`jsonMapperBuilder()`), while also improving variable naming.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to fix or update the method call to match the correct API usage (`activateDefaultTyping` instead of `enableDefaultTyping`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and likely correct.
   - The variable name `mapper` is more descriptive than `m`, so it should be kept.
   - The method `jsonMapperBuilder()` is likely the correct or preferred way to create the mapper.
   - The method `activateDefaultTyping` is likely the correct method name.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both changes: use `mapper` as the variable name, use `jsonMapperBuilder()`, and use `activateDefaultTyping`.

ObjectMapper mapper = jsonMapperBuilder()
                .activateDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
