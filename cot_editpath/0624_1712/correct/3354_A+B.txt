### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

con.prepareStatement(
                "SELECT FILE_NAME FROM ACCOUNT_PATCH_REVIEWS "
                    + "WHERE ACCOUNT_ID = ? AND CHANGE_ID = ? AND PATCH_SET_ID = ?")) {

con.prepareStatement("SELECT FILE_NAME FROM ACCOUNT_PATCH_REVIEWS "

con.prepareStatement("SELECT FILE_NAME FROM account_patch_reviews "
                + "WHERE account_id = ? AND change_id = ? AND patch_set_id = ?")) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline>


## From base to b
<REPLACE> ACCOUNT_PATCH_REVIEWS <WITH> account_patch_reviews)
<REPLACE> ACCOUNT_ID <WITH> account_id)
<REPLACE> CHANGE_ID <WITH> change_id)
<REPLACE> PATCH_SET_ID <WITH> patch_set_id)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the SQL query uses uppercase table and column names (`ACCOUNT_PATCH_REVIEWS`, `ACCOUNT_ID`, etc.).
   - In branch `a`, there is no visible change to the SQL query compared to the base (only a newline is added).
   - In branch `b`, the SQL query is modified to use lowercase table and column names (`account_patch_reviews`, `account_id`, etc.).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** does not modify the SQL query itself, so it does not introduce any functional or stylistic change.
   - **Branch `b`** changes the SQL query to use lowercase identifiers. This could be for consistency with a database schema that uses lowercase names or to follow a specific code style guideline.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely does not intend to change the SQL query but may be adding a newline for formatting or readability.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to align the code with a database schema that uses lowercase identifiers or to follow a code style that prefers lowercase for SQL identifiers.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` does not modify the SQL query, the only meaningful change comes from branch `b`.
   - The use of lowercase identifiers in SQL is often preferred when the database schema uses lowercase names, as it avoids potential case sensitivity issues.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from branch `b` and discard the unchanged base version from branch `a`.
