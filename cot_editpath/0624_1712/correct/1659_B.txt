### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
return (database instanceof AbstractDb2Database) || (database instanceof MSSQLDatabase) || (database instanceof
            OracleDatabase);
||||||| base
return database instanceof AbstractDb2Database || database instanceof MSSQLDatabase || database instanceof OracleDatabase;
=======
return database instanceof AbstractDb2Database || database instanceof MSSQLDatabase || database instanceof OracleDatabase
                || database instanceof PostgresDatabase;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ( ) ( ) ( <newline> )


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> | | database instanceof PostgresDatabase


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code is:
     ```java
     return database instanceof AbstractDb2Database || database instanceof MSSQLDatabase || database instanceof OracleDatabase;
     ```
   - Branch `a` adds parentheses and a newline:
     ```java
     return (database instanceof AbstractDb2Database) || (database instanceof MSSQLDatabase) || (database instanceof
             OracleDatabase);
     ```
   - Branch `b` adds a new condition for `PostgresDatabase`:
     ```java
     return database instanceof AbstractDb2Database || database instanceof MSSQLDatabase || database instanceof OracleDatabase
                 || database instanceof PostgresDatabase;
     ```

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The addition of parentheses is likely for clarity or to enforce a specific logical grouping, though in this case the logical grouping is already unambiguous due to the left-to-right evaluation of `||`.
     - The newline is a formatting change and does not affect functionality.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `PostgresDatabase` is a functional change that expands the set of supported databases.
     - This change is likely motivated by the need to include PostgreSQL in the logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to improve readability or align with a specific code style.
   - **Branch `b`** clearly aimed to extend functionality by including support for PostgreSQL.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The parentheses in `a` are not necessary for correctness but may be stylistic. They can be safely removed without affecting logic.
   - The addition of `PostgresDatabase` in `b` is a meaningful and necessary functional change.
   - The newline in `a` is a formatting choice and can be adjusted to match the overall code style.
   - The best resolution is to include the new condition from `b` and simplify the formatting to match a clean, readable style.
