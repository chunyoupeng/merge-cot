### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> CommonTest <WITH> AllUnitTests)
<DELETE> . class , <newline> StudentTest . class , <newline> TeamDataTest . class , <newline> EvalResultDataTest . class , <newline> TeamEvalResultTest . class , <newline> HtmlHelperTest <newline>


## From base to b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed several unit test classes (`StudentTest`, `TeamDataTest`, etc.) and replaced `CommonTest` with `AllUnitTests`.
   - **Branch `b`** added two new UI test classes: `CoordEvalPageUiTest` and `CoordEvalResultsPageUiTest`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** appears to be a consolidation of unit tests by removing individual test classes and replacing them with a single class `AllUnitTests`. This could be an effort to simplify the test suite or to use a more comprehensive test runner.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** adds new UI tests related to evaluation pages, which likely reflects new features or functionality in the UI.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to streamline the test suite by reducing the number of individual unit test classes and using a single class to represent all unit tests.
   - **Branch `b`** is focused on expanding the test coverage by adding new UI tests for evaluation-related pages.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of `a` to consolidate unit tests is valid and should be preserved.
   - The intention of `b` to add new UI tests is also valid and should be preserved.
   - The conflict arises because `a` removed some test classes and `b` added new ones. Since these are in different categories (unit tests vs. UI tests), they can coexist.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include `AllUnitTests` from `a` and the new UI tests from `b`.
