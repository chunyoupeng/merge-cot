### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private void addGraphs(final Set<String> graphAuths, final String userId, final Builder... builders) throws StoreException {
||||||| base
private void addGraphs(final Set<String> graphAuths, final String userId, final Builder... builders) {
=======
private void addGraphs(final Set<String> graphAuths, final String userId, final boolean isPublic, final Builder... builders) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> throws StoreException


## From base to b
<ADD> boolean isPublic , final


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** added `throws StoreException` to the method signature. This indicates that the method may now throw a `StoreException`, likely due to new logic introduced in this branch.
   - **Branch b** added a new parameter `final boolean isPublic` to the method signature. This suggests that the method now needs to consider whether the graph is public or not, which is a new functional requirement.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change (`throws StoreException`)** is likely necessary if the method now performs operations that can fail and should propagate such failures via exceptions.
   - **Branch b's change (`boolean isPublic`)** is also likely necessary if the method now needs to handle graph visibility (public vs. private), which is a new functional requirement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention** is to make the method signature reflect that it can throw a `StoreException`, which is important for correctness and clarity.
   - **Branch b's intention** is to introduce a new parameter to support logic that depends on whether the graph is public or not.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are semantically and functionally distinct and do not conflict with each other.
   - The method should now include both the new parameter `isPublic` and the `throws StoreException` clause.
   - The correct resolution is to merge both changes into the final method signature.

```java
private void addGraphs(final Set<String> graphAuths, final String userId, final boolean isPublic, final Builder... builders) throws StoreException {
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
private void addGraphs(final Set<String> graphAuths,
                           final String userId, final boolean isPublic, final Builder... builders) throws StoreException {
