### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

interface HasLocale {
        String LOCALE = "locale";

        Locale getLocale();

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, so both branches `a` and `b` are adding entirely new interfaces.
   - Branch `a` introduces an interface `HasLocale` with methods related to locale handling.
   - Branch `b` introduces an interface `HasSamplingGeometry` with methods related to geometry sampling.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both interfaces are distinct and serve different purposes: one is for locale management, the other for geometry sampling.
   - There is no overlap in functionality or naming between the two interfaces.
   - Since the base is empty, there is no conflict in the actual code structure or contentâ€”both branches are adding new code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a standard interface for locale handling.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide a standard interface for sampling geometry.
   - Both are likely intended to be used independently or in different parts of the codebase.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both interfaces are completely separate and do not interfere with each other, the best resolution is to merge both interfaces into the final code.
   - No changes need to be made to either interface.
   - The final code should include both interfaces as they are.

```java
interface HasLocale {
    String LOCALE = "locale";

    Locale getLocale();

    HasLocale setLocale(Locale locale);

    boolean isSetLocale();
}

interface HasSamplingGeometry {
    String SAMPLING_GEOMETRY = "samplingGeometry";

    Geometry getSamplingGeometry();

    void setSamplingGeometry(Geometry samplingGeometry);

    boolean hasSamplingGeometry();
}
