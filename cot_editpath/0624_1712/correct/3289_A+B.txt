You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> final final final
<REPLACE> RetryService <WITH> final)
<ADD> FailedPaymentRetryService final final , <newline> final GlobalLocker locker


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> Bus eventBus


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Added the keyword `final` to all constructor parameters.
     - Replaced `RetryService` with `FailedPaymentRetryService`.
     - Added a new parameter `GlobalLocker locker`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a new parameter `Bus eventBus`.

   The conflict arises because both branches added new parameters to the constructor, and `a` also modified the type of the `retryService` parameter.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Adding `final` to all parameters is a good practice for immutability and clarity.
     - Replacing `RetryService` with `FailedPaymentRetryService` suggests a more specific or renamed interface.
     - Adding `GlobalLocker locker` introduces a new dependency, likely for concurrency or locking purposes.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Adding `Bus eventBus` introduces a new dependency, likely for event publishing or messaging.

   Both changes are likely intended to enhance the functionality of the `DefaultPaymentApi` class.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to improve type specificity (`FailedPaymentRetryService`), add a locking mechanism (`GlobalLocker`), and enforce immutability via `final`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to add event-driven capabilities via `Bus`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `final` keyword should be applied to all parameters for consistency and immutability.
   - The `FailedPaymentRetryService` should be used instead of `RetryService` to reflect the more specific type.
   - Both new parameters (`GlobalLocker locker` and `Bus eventBus`) should be included to preserve the functionality added by both branches.
   - The constructor should be updated to include all these changes in a clean and readable format.
