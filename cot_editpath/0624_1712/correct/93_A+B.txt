### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> BlockImpl <WITH> Block)
<REPLACE> BlockImpl <WITH> Block)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> AplGlobalObjects <WITH> blockchainConfig)
<DELETE> . getChainConfig ( )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **From base to a:** The method signature changed from `BlockImpl block` to `Block block`, and the same replacement was made for the `previousBlock` parameter. This suggests that `a` is generalizing the method to accept any `Block` type, not just `BlockImpl`.
   - **From base to b:** The method replaced `AplGlobalObjects.getChainConfig().getCurrentConfig()` with `blockchainConfig.getCurrentConfig()`. This implies that `b` is using a local or injected configuration object instead of a global singleton.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in a:** Replacing `BlockImpl` with `Block` is a good design choice if the method does not rely on implementation-specific features of `BlockImpl`. It increases flexibility and decouples the method from a specific implementation.
   - **Change in b:** Replacing the global configuration access with a local variable (`blockchainConfig`) is also a good design choice. It promotes better testability and reduces dependency on global state, which is generally a good software engineering practice.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **a's intention:** To make the method more flexible and reusable by accepting any `Block` type.
   - **b's intention:** To reduce coupling with the global configuration singleton and use a more modular approach by injecting or using a local configuration object.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are beneficial and orthogonal (they modify different parts of the code). The method signature should use `Block` instead of `BlockImpl` to maintain flexibility, and the configuration access should use `blockchainConfig` instead of the global singleton.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both changes.
