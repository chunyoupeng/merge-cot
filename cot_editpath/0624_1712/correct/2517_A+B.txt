### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

InitializeGlobalNode[] initGlobals, InitializeModuleNode[] initModules) throws TypeOverflowException {
||||||| base
InitializeModuleNode[] initModules) throws TypeOverflowException {
=======
InitializeModuleNode[] initModules, boolean lazyParsing, boolean isSulongLibrary) throws TypeOverflowException {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> InitializeGlobalNode [ ] initGlobals ,


## From base to b
<ADD> , boolean lazyParsing , boolean isSulongLibrary


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method signature is:
     ```java
     InitializeModuleNode[] initModules) throws TypeOverflowException {
     ```
   - In branch `a`, a new parameter `InitializeGlobalNode[] initGlobals` is added before `initModules`.
   - In branch `b`, two new boolean parameters `lazyParsing` and `isSulongLibrary` are added after `initModules`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `initGlobals` introduces a new array of `InitializeGlobalNode` objects. This likely represents a new feature or functionality related to global node initialization.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `lazyParsing` and `isSulongLibrary` introduces configuration flags. These are likely used to control parsing behavior and library-specific logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To support a new mechanism for global node initialization, which is likely orthogonal to the parsing and library logic.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To provide more fine-grained control over parsing behavior and library-specific handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are additive and serve different purposes. `initGlobals` is a new data structure, while `lazyParsing` and `isSulongLibrary` are configuration flags.
   - Since the parameters are of different types and serve different purposes, they can be safely combined in the method signature.
   - The correct resolution is to merge both changes, preserving the order of parameters as they appear in the respective branches.

# Final resolution
```java
InitializeGlobalNode[] initGlobals, InitializeModuleNode[] initModules, boolean lazyParsing, boolean isSulongLibrary) throws TypeOverflowException {
```
