### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two sets of `@Autowired` fields.
   - **Branch a** added the following fields:
     - `scanAndMarkNoteByIvkServlet`
     - `scanNoteByIvkServlet`
     - `scanNoteByOvkServlet`
     - `getMerkleTreeVoucherInfoServlet`
     - `isSpendServlet`
   - **Branch b** added the following fields:
     - `getBrokerageServlet`
     - `getRewardServlet`
     - `triggerConstantContractServlet`
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own set of fields.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding different sets of beans, which are likely related to different functionalities.
   - There is no overlap in the beans added by a and b.
   - Since both sets of beans are likely required for the application to function correctly, both should be retained.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** appears to be adding beans related to scanning and marking notes, as well as checking spend status and retrieving Merkle tree information.
   - **Branch b** appears to be adding beans related to retrieving brokerage and reward information and triggering a contract.
   - The intentions are distinct and likely serve different parts of the application.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of beans are distinct and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to merge both sets into the final code.
   - The order of the beans can be preserved as in the original branches, or sorted alphabetically for consistency.
   - No changes are needed to the code structure or logic.
