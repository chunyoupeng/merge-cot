### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
//@FindBy(linkText="https://github.com/guipdutra/test_issues_kanboard/issues/new")
=======
@FindBy(linkText="Advanced options")
	WebElement advancedOptions;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<DELETE> / /
<REPLACE> https <WITH> Advanced)
<REPLACE> : <WITH> options)
<DELETE> / / github . com / guipdutra / test_issues_kanboard / issues / new
<ADD> <newline> WebElement advancedOptions ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, there is a commented-out `@FindBy` annotation with a link text pointing to a GitHub URL.
   - In branch `a`, all content from the base has been removed.
   - In branch `b`, the same line is modified to define a new `@FindBy` annotation with the link text "Advanced options", and a new `WebElement` variable `advancedOptions` is added.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** removes the entire line, which suggests it might be deprecating or removing the element from the codebase.
   - **Branch `b`** reuses the same line but changes the link text to "Advanced options" and adds a new `WebElement` variable. This indicates an intention to keep and reuse the element but with a different label.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to remove the element from the codebase, possibly because it is no longer used or relevant.
   - **Branch `b`** intends to keep the element but update its label to match a new UI design or functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - If the element is still relevant and used in the application, **branch `b`'s change should be kept**, as it updates the element to reflect the new UI.
   - If the element is no longer used, **branch `a`'s change should be kept**.
   - Since the intention of `b` is to update the element rather than remove it, and the change is semantically meaningful, it is more likely to be the correct resolution.
