### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
protected void preInvoke(Row input, ResultFuture<Row> resultFuture) { }
||||||| base
protected void preInvoke(Row input, ResultFuture<BaseRow> resultFuture) { }
=======
protected void preInvoke(Row input, ResultFuture<BaseRow> resultFuture) {
    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> BaseRow <WITH> Row)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method signature is:  
     `protected void preInvoke(Row input, ResultFuture<BaseRow> resultFuture) { }`
   - In branch `a`, the change is:  
     `protected void preInvoke(Row input, ResultFuture<Row> resultFuture) { }`  
     This means the generic type of `ResultFuture` was changed from `BaseRow` to `Row`.
   - In branch `b`, the change is:  
     `protected void preInvoke(Row input, ResultFuture<BaseRow> resultFuture) { }`  
     This means a newline was added after the method body, but the method signature and content remain the same as the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:**  
     Changing `ResultFuture<BaseRow>` to `ResultFuture<Row>` is a meaningful type change. It suggests that the method is now expecting a `Row` object to be returned instead of a `BaseRow`. This could be intentional if `Row` is a more specific or updated type in the context of the application.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:**  
     The only change is the addition of a newline. This is a stylistic change and does not affect the logic or functionality of the method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:**  
     The intention is likely to update the generic type of the `ResultFuture` to match the expected return type of the method. This could be part of a broader effort to align the method with a new or more specific data model.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:**  
     The intention is likely to improve code formatting or readability by adding a newline after the method body. This is a minor and non-essential change.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in branch `a` is more significant and likely reflects a functional update that should be preserved.
   - The change in branch `b` is trivial and can be safely ignored or applied separately if formatting is a concern.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the method signature from branch `a` and retain the empty method body.
