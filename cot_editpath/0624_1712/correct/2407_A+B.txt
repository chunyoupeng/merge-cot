### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
c.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);
||||||| base
c.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);
                			if(!mUndo){
                				c.drawBitmap(mActiveBitmap, 0, 0, null);
                			}
=======
c.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> if ( ! mUndo ) { <newline> c . drawBitmap ( mActiveBitmap , 0 , 0 , null ) ; <newline> }


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> if ( ! mUndo ) { <newline> c . drawBitmap ( mActiveBitmap , 0 , 0 , null ) ; <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code includes a conditional block that draws `mActiveBitmap` if `mUndo` is false.
   - Both `a` and `b` have **deleted** this conditional block entirely.
   - The only line that remains in both `a` and `b` is the line: `c.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` removed the same conditional logic from the base.
   - The intention appears to be to **simplify the drawing logic** by removing the conditional rendering of `mActiveBitmap`.
   - Since both branches removed the same code, there is no conflicting logic between them—only a shared deletion.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both `a` and `b` seems to be to **remove the conditional rendering of `mActiveBitmap`**, possibly because it is no longer needed or is being handled elsewhere.
   - There is no evidence of a functional conflict—both branches are removing the same code.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches removed the same conditional block and only kept the same line of code (`c.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);`), the merge is straightforward.
   - The final code should reflect the shared change: removing the conditional block and keeping the unconditional draw of `mBitmap`.

c.drawBitmap(mBitmap, 0, 0, null);
