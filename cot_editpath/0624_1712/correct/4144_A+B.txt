### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

// TODO

        if(LocalWorkflowConstants.CONTEXT_NAME_PROC_DEF_KEY.equals(bindParamName)){
            String procDefKey = procInstEntity.getProcDefKey();
            objectVals.add(procDefKey);
            return;
        }

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> TODO <WITH> #)
<ADD> 1993


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> / / 1 <newline> if ( LocalWorkflowConstants . CONTEXT_NAME_PROC_DEF_KEY . equals ( bindParamName ) ) { <newline> String procDefKey = procInstEntity . getProcDefKey ( ) ; <newline> objectVals . add ( procDefKey ) ; <newline> return ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> / / 2


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the `TODO` comment with `// #1993`.
     - This appears to be a placeholder or reference to an issue or task number.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a block of code that checks if `bindParamName` is equal to `LocalWorkflowConstants.CONTEXT_NAME_PROC_DEF_KEY`.
     - If so, it retrieves a process definition key from `procInstEntity`, adds it to `objectVals`, and returns early.
     - This is a functional change that introduces a new logic path.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change is minimal and likely used to mark a task or issue reference.
     - It does not interfere with the logic of the code.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - This is a significant functional addition that introduces a new conditional logic path.
     - It is likely intended to handle a specific case where the bind parameter name matches a known constant.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is likely to mark a task or issue for tracking purposes.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to add a specific logic path to handle a known bind parameter, likely for performance or correctness reasons.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `a` is a comment and does not interfere with the logic introduced in `b`.
   - The change in `b` is a functional addition that should be preserved.
   - The two changes are orthogonal and can coexist.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both the task reference from `a` and the logic from `b`.
