### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
facesMessages.addToControl("email",
                    "#{msgs['javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED']}");
||||||| base
FacesMessages.instance().addToControl("email",
                    "#{msgs['javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED']}");
=======
FacesMessages.instance().addToControl("email",
                "#{msgs['javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED']}");
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> FacesMessages <WITH> facesMessages)
<DELETE> . instance ( )



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:  
     `FacesMessages.instance().addToControl("email", "#{msgs['javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED']}");`
   - In branch `a`, the line is:  
     `facesMessages.addToControl("email", "#{msgs['javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED']}");`  
     This removes the static method call `.instance()` and changes the class name from `FacesMessages` to `facesMessages`, suggesting a shift from a static utility to an instance variable.
   - In branch `b`, the line is the same as in the base code, with no changes.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely refactoring the code to use an instance of `FacesMessages` instead of the static method `instance()`. This could be part of a broader effort to reduce reliance on static utility methods and promote better testability or encapsulation.
   - **Branch `b`** has no changes, so it preserves the original behavior and structure.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to move away from a static utility pattern to an instance-based approach, which is a common refactoring in object-oriented design.
   - The intention in `b` is to maintain the status quo, possibly because the code is working as expected and no changes are needed.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` introduces a meaningful and likely beneficial refactoring (reducing static dependencies), and `b` makes no changes, the correct resolution is to adopt the change from `a`. This aligns with modern software design principles and improves testability and maintainability.
