### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added new methods to an empty base file.
   - Branch `a` added methods related to `haltOnError`, a boolean flag that determines whether crawling should stop on an unexpected error.
   - Branch `b` added methods related to `batchReadSize`, an integer that determines how many pages to fetch/process in a single read transaction.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The `haltOnError` functionality is related to error handling and control flow, while `batchReadSize` is related to performance and data processing.
   - Neither change is redundant or conflicting with the other in terms of logic or code structure.
   - Both sets of methods follow the same naming and style conventions (getter and setter methods with Javadoc comments).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a mechanism to control the behavior of the system in the event of an error.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide a mechanism to configure the batch size for data processing, likely for performance tuning.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of methods are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes into a single file.
   - No changes need to be discarded or modified.
   - The final file will include both `haltOnError` and `batchReadSize` methods, preserving the functionality and intentions of both branches.
