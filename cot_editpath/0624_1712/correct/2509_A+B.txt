### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
CheckTypeVisitor visitor = new CheckTypeVisitor.Builder(context, myErrorReporter).build();
    ClassDefinition thisClass = getThisClass(def, myNamespaceMember.namespace);
    Map<String, Binding> polyParams = new HashMap<>();
||||||| base
CheckTypeVisitor visitor = new CheckTypeVisitor.Builder(context, myErrorReporter).build();
    ClassDefinition thisClass = getThisClass(def, myNamespaceMember.namespace);
=======
CheckTypeVisitor visitor = new CheckTypeVisitor.Builder(myState, context, myErrorReporter).build(def);
    ClassDefinition thisClass = getThisClass(def);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> Map < String , Binding > polyParams = new HashMap < > ( ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> myState , def
<DELETE> , myNamespaceMember . namespace


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Added a new line: `Map<String, Binding> polyParams = new HashMap<>();`
     - This suggests that `a` is introducing a new variable `polyParams` to store some kind of parameter bindings, likely for polymorphism or generic type handling.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Modified the constructor call to `CheckTypeVisitor.Builder` by adding `myState` as the first argument and `def` as the last argument.
     - Removed the argument `myNamespaceMember.namespace` from the `getThisClass` method call.
     - This suggests that `b` is updating the builder to use a new state object and is simplifying the `getThisClass` method by removing the namespace parameter.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - The addition of `polyParams` is likely a new feature or enhancement to support additional type checking logic.
     - This change is additive and does not interfere with the existing logic in `b`.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The constructor call to `CheckTypeVisitor.Builder` is updated to include `myState` and `def`, which may reflect a new design or API change.
     - The removal of `myNamespaceMember.namespace` from `getThisClass` implies that the method no longer requires the namespace to determine the class, which could be due to a refactoring or simplification.
     - These changes are likely necessary for the updated logic in `b`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely adding support for polymorphic parameters in the type checking logic.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely refactoring the code to use a new state object and simplifying the `getThisClass` method.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `a` and `b` are largely orthogonal: one is adding a new variable, and the other is updating method calls and constructor usage.
   - The `polyParams` variable from `a` can be safely added to the merged code.
   - The updated constructor call and method call from `b` should be used in the merged code.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should include both changes.

# Final Resolution

```java
CheckTypeVisitor visitor = new CheckTypeVisitor.Builder(myState, context, myErrorReporter).build(def);
    ClassDefinition thisClass = getThisClass(def);
    Map<String, Binding> polyParams = new HashMap<>();
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
CheckTypeVisitor visitor = new CheckTypeVisitor.Builder(myState, context, myErrorReporter).build(def);
    ClassDefinition thisClass = getThisClass(def);
    Map<String, Binding> polyParams = new HashMap<>();
