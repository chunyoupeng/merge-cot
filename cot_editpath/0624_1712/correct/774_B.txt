### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public class ViewKeyMainFragment extends Fragment implements
        LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>{
||||||| base
public class ViewKeyMainFragment extends Fragment  implements
        LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>{
=======
public class ViewKeyMainFragment extends Fragment implements
        LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> {
<<<<<<< b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the line where the class `ViewKeyMainFragment` is declared.
   - In the **base** version, the class declaration is:
     ```java
     public class ViewKeyMainFragment extends Fragment  implements
             LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>{
     ```
     Note the extra space between `Fragment` and `implements`.
   - In **branch a**, the line is:
     ```java
     public class ViewKeyMainFragment extends Fragment implements
             LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor>{
     ```
     The extra space between `Fragment` and `implements` has been removed.
   - In **branch b**, the line is the same as in **branch a**:
     ```java
     public class ViewKeyMainFragment extends Fragment implements
             LoaderManager.LoaderCallbacks<Cursor> {
     ```
     The only difference from **branch a** is the addition of a space before the opening `{`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** removed the unnecessary space between `Fragment` and `implements`, which is a minor code style improvement.
   - **Branch b** also removed the space between `Fragment` and `implements`, but added a space before the opening `{`, which is a common style in Java for class declarations.
   - Both changes are stylistic and do not affect functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely aimed to clean up whitespace for consistency or to follow a stricter code style.
   - **Branch b** likely aimed to follow a specific code style convention where the opening brace of a class is placed on a new line with a space before it.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches aim to improve code style, and **branch b**'s version includes a space before the opening `{`, which is a more common and readable style in Java, it is better to adopt **branch b**'s version.
   - This choice ensures consistency with common Java formatting standards and readability.
