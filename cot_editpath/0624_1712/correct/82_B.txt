### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base

=======
/**
     * Post an error message for the user.
     * 
     * @param subj    The error subject.
     * @param details The error details.
     */
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, where both have made changes to the same file.
   - From the provided content:
     - `a` has introduced a Java method comment for a method `postErrorMessage` with parameters `subj` and `details`.
     - `b` has added a block of text that is not Java code (e.g., "Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences...").
   - The base is empty, so both `a` and `b` are adding content to the same file.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s change is a valid Java method comment, which is likely part of a method implementation or declaration.
   - `b`'s change is not Java code and appears to be a description or documentation of the merge process, not part of the actual codebase.
   - Since the base is empty, both changes are new additions, but they are fundamentally different in nature.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to define or document a method for posting error messages.
   - The intention of `b` is unclear in the context of the codebase. It seems to be a meta-comment about the merge process, not a functional part of the code.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The content from `a` is relevant and should be retained as it contributes to the codebase.
   - The content from `b` is not relevant to the code and should be discarded.
   - The resolution should keep the Java method comment from `a` and remove the non-code content from `b`.
