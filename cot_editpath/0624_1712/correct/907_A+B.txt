### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

final ServiceContext serviceContext = DefaultServiceContext.create(ksqlConfig);

    return buildApplication(
        restConfig,

        serviceContext,

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline> , <newline> KsqlRestServiceContextBinder : : new


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> new LazyServiceContext ( ( ) - > )
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new parameter `KsqlRestServiceContextBinder::new` to the `buildApplication` method call. This suggests that `a` is modifying the method signature to include a new context binder.
   - **Branch `b`** replaced the direct instantiation of `DefaultServiceContext` with a `LazyServiceContext` that lazily initializes the `DefaultServiceContext`. This implies that `b` is optimizing or deferring the initialization of the service context.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a new argument to the `buildApplication` method. This is likely a functional change that adds a new feature or dependency. It should be preserved if the method supports this new argument and the intention is to enhance the application with the binder.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces lazy initialization, which is a performance or resource management improvement. This is a non-functional change that should be preserved if the goal is to optimize resource usage.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to enhance the application by adding a context binder, which may be necessary for new functionality or integration.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to optimize the initialization of the service context by deferring it until needed, which is a common performance optimization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The lazy initialization (`b`) is a refactor that should be preserved, and the new argument (`a`) is a functional enhancement that should also be preserved.
   - The conflict can be resolved by combining both changes: use the `LazyServiceContext` from `b` and include the new argument from `a` in the `buildApplication` call.

```java
final ServiceContext serviceContext
        = new LazyServiceContext(() -> DefaultServiceContext.create(ksqlConfig));
    return buildApplication(
        restConfig,
        versionCheckerFactory,
        maxStatementRetries,
        serviceContext,
        KsqlRestServiceContextBinder::new);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
final ServiceContext serviceContext
        = new LazyServiceContext(() -> DefaultServiceContext.create(ksqlConfig));

    return buildApplication(
        restConfig,
        versionCheckerFactory,
        maxStatementRetries,
        serviceContext,
        KsqlRestServiceContextBinder::new);
