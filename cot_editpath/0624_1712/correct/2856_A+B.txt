### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , <newline> 2


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> PagingFailoverTest . <newline> PagingFailoverTest . <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the parameter `2` at the end of the `createInVMFailoverServer` method call. This suggests that `a` is passing an additional argument to the method, likely to configure some behavior (e.g., a timeout, retry count, or identifier).
   - **Branch `b`** removed the fully qualified names `PagingFailoverTest.PAGE_SIZE` and `PagingFailoverTest.PAGE_MAX`, replacing them with just `PAGE_SIZE` and `PAGE_MAX`. This implies that `b` assumes these constants are now in the current scope (e.g., imported or defined locally), and no longer need to be fully qualified.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a new parameter. This is a significant change and likely reflects a new feature or configuration option. If the method signature in `createInVMFailoverServer` now accepts this parameter, it should be retained.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** simplifies the code by removing redundant fully qualified names. This is a minor refactoring and is likely safe if the constants are now in scope. However, if the constants are not in scope, this would cause a compilation error.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to enhance the method call with additional configuration.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to clean up the code by removing unnecessary fully qualified names, assuming the constants are now accessible in the current scope.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change from `a` (adding the parameter `2`) is likely more significant and should be retained, assuming the method signature supports it.
   - The change from `b` (removing fully qualified names) is a minor refactoring and can be applied if the constants are now in scope.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both changes: remove the fully qualified names and add the new parameter.

return createInVMFailoverServer(true,
                                      configuration,
                                      PAGE_SIZE,
                                      PAGE_MAX,
                                      new HashMap<String, AddressSettings>(),
                                      nodeManager,
                                      2);
