### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import org.mskcc.cbio.portal.html.special_gene.SpecialGeneFactory;
||||||| base

=======
import org.mskcc.cbio.portal.util.ExtendedMutationUtil;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statement section of the file.
   - Branch `a` added the import: `import org.mskcc.cbio.portal.html.special_gene.SpecialGeneFactory;`
   - Branch `b` added the import: `import org.mskcc.cbio.portal.util.ExtendedMutationUtil;`
   - The base is empty, meaning both branches independently added their own import statements.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both imports are likely used in the file for their respective functionalities.
   - `SpecialGeneFactory` is likely used for handling special gene-related logic in HTML rendering.
   - `ExtendedMutationUtil` is likely used for extended mutation processing or utilities.
   - Since both imports are from different packages and serve different purposes, they are not conflicting in functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to add functionality related to special gene handling in HTML.
   - The intention of `b` is to add functionality related to mutation processing.
   - Both changes are additive and do not interfere with each other.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both imports should be retained.
   - The resolution is to combine both import statements into the final file.
   - No modification is needed since the two imports are independent and serve different purposes.
