### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
final List<Map<String, Object>> queryResult = handle.select("select * from _invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off where account_id = ? and is_active = '1'", accountId.toString());
||||||| base
final List<Map<String, Object>> queryResult = handle.select("select * from _invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off where account_id = ? and is_active", accountId.toString());
=======
final List<Map<String, Object>> queryResult = handle.select("select * from invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off where account_id = ? and is_active", accountId.toString());
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> = ' 1 '


## From base to b
<REPLACE> _invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off <WITH> invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the SQL query condition from `is_active` to `is_active = '1'`. This adds a specific value comparison to the `is_active` column.
   - **Branch `b`** changed the table name from `_invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off` to `invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off`, removing the leading underscore.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** Adding `= '1'` to `is_active` makes the query more explicit. It ensures that only records where `is_active` is `'1'` are selected. This is likely a correction or clarification to ensure the query behaves as intended, especially if the column is a string or character type.
   - **Change in `b`:** Changing the table name from `_invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off` to `invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off` suggests a renaming of the table in the database. This could be part of a cleanup or naming convention update.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to ensure the query is more precise and unambiguous, especially if the `is_active` column is a string or character type.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to update the code to reflect a new table name in the database, possibly to follow a new naming convention or to remove a prefix.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and should be incorporated into the final code.
   - The table name from `b` should be used (`invoice_payment_control_plugin_auto_pay_off`).
   - The explicit condition from `a` (`is_active = '1'`) should be used to ensure the query is precise.
   - The final SQL query should reflect both changes.
