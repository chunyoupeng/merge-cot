### Prompt

You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@Order(62)
	@ExportEntity(LocationDto.class)
	@ExportProperty({
		EventDto.EVENT_LOCATION,
		LocationDto.CITY })
||||||| base
@Order(62)
	@ExportProperty(EventParticipantExportDto.EVENT_CITY)
=======
@Order(74)
	@ExportProperty(EventParticipantExportDto.EVENT_CITY)
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ExportEntity ( LocationDto . class ) <newline> @
<REPLACE> EventParticipantExportDto <WITH> {)
<ADD> <newline> EventDto
<REPLACE> EVENT_CITY <WITH> EVENT_LOCATION)
<ADD> , <newline> LocationDto . CITY }


## From base to b
<REPLACE> 62 <WITH> 74)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Adds `@ExportEntity(LocationDto.class)` above `@ExportProperty`.
     - Replaces `EventParticipantExportDto.EVENT_CITY` with a new `@ExportProperty` that includes `EventDto.EVENT_LOCATION` and `LocationDto.CITY`.
     - Increases the number of properties being exported.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Only modifies the `@Order` value from `62` to `74`.
     - No changes to the `@ExportProperty` content.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The addition of `@ExportEntity` and the new `@ExportProperty` suggests an intention to enhance the export functionality by including more detailed location data.
     - This change is likely to be **important** if the application now needs to export both event location and city information.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The change to `@Order(74)` is a **minor** adjustment in the order of export properties.
     - This change is likely to be **safe** to keep, as it doesn't affect the content being exported, only the order.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely trying to **expand the export functionality** to include more detailed location data.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely trying to **reorder the export properties** for better organization or user experience.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are **independent** and do not conflict directly.
   - The `@Order` change from `b` can be **merged** with the `@ExportProperty` and `@ExportEntity` changes from `a`.
   - The final result should include both the **enhanced export properties** and the **updated order**.

```java
@Order(74)
	@ExportEntity(LocationDto.class)
	@ExportProperty({
		EventDto.EVENT_LOCATION,
		LocationDto.CITY })
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
@Order(74)
	@ExportEntity(LocationDto.class)
	@ExportProperty({
		EventDto.EVENT_LOCATION,
		LocationDto.CITY })
