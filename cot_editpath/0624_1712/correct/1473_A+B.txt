### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> <newline> public ResourceMeasurementBatchResponse getAggregatedMetricData ( ApiMessageContext apiMessageContext , final ResourceMeasurementRequests hqMsmtReqs , <newline> final String begin , final String end ) <newline> throws ParseException , PermissionException , UnsupportedOperationException , ObjectNotFoundException ;


## From base to b
<ADD> , UnsupportedOperationException , ObjectNotFoundException , IllegalArgumentException , TimeframeSizeException , TimeframeBoundriesException


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Introduced a new method `getAggregatedMetricData` with the following parameters:
       - `ApiMessageContext apiMessageContext`
       - `final ResourceMeasurementRequests hqMsmtReqs`
       - `final String begin`
       - `final String end`
     - Added new exceptions to the method signature: `UnsupportedOperationException`, `ObjectNotFoundException`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Modified the existing method (or a similar one) by adding the following exceptions to the `throws` clause:
       - `UnsupportedOperationException`
       - `ObjectNotFoundException`
       - `IllegalArgumentException`
       - `TimeframeSizeException`
       - `TimeframeBoundriesException`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The addition of a new method `getAggregatedMetricData` is a structural change that introduces a new API endpoint or functionality.
     - The inclusion of `UnsupportedOperationException` and `ObjectNotFoundException` in the `throws` clause is likely to handle specific error conditions related to the new method's logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of multiple exceptions to the `throws` clause suggests that the method is being extended to handle more granular error conditions, possibly for better error reporting or validation.
     - The exceptions like `IllegalArgumentException`, `TimeframeSizeException`, and `TimeframeBoundriesException` indicate that the method is now validating input parameters more rigorously.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to introduce a new method for retrieving aggregated metric data, which likely serves a different use case or client.
     - The added exceptions are specific to the new method's behavior and are likely tied to its implementation.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to enhance the robustness of the existing method by adding more detailed error handling for input validation and time-bound constraints.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two branches are modifying different parts of the codebase:
     - `a` is introducing a new method.
     - `b` is enhancing an existing method's exception handling.
   - Since the two changes are orthogonal (they affect different methods), the best resolution is to **keep both changes**.
   - The new method from `a` should be retained, and the enhanced exception handling from `b` should be applied to the appropriate method (likely the one already present in the base or another method).
   - No conflict exists between the two changes, so the resolution is to **merge both changes without conflict**.

# Final Resolution

```java
final String rscId, final String begin, final String end) throws ParseException, PermissionException, UnsupportedOperationException, ObjectNotFoundException, IllegalArgumentException, TimeframeSizeException, TimeframeBoundriesException;
    
    public ResourceMeasurementBatchResponse getAggregatedMetricData(ApiMessageContext apiMessageContext, final ResourceMeasurementRequests hqMsmtReqs, 
            final String begin, final String end) 
            throws ParseException, PermissionException, UnsupportedOperationException, ObjectNotFoundException;
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
final String rscId, final String begin, final String end) throws ParseException, PermissionException, UnsupportedOperationException, ObjectNotFoundException, IllegalArgumentException, TimeframeSizeException, TimeframeBoundriesException;
    
    public ResourceMeasurementBatchResponse getAggregatedMetricData(ApiMessageContext apiMessageContext, final ResourceMeasurementRequests hqMsmtReqs, 
            final String begin, final String end) 
            throws ParseException, PermissionException, UnsupportedOperationException, ObjectNotFoundException;
