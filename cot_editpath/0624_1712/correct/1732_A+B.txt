### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public static final String SNAPSHOT_PATH                    = "snapshot.path";
||||||| base

=======
public static final String WEBSOCKET_FRONTEND_ACCESS        = "WebSocketServlet.frontendAccess";
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**  
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` added a new constant to a file that was empty in the base.  
   - Branch `a` added:  
     ```java
     public static final String SNAPSHOT_PATH = "snapshot.path";
     ```  
   - Branch `b` added:  
     ```java
     public static final String WEBSOCKET_FRONTEND_ACCESS = "WebSocketServlet.frontendAccess";
     ```  
   - Since the base is empty, there is no overlap in the actual code content, but Git marks this as a conflict because both branches added content to the same file.

2. **Evaluate each change:**  
   - Both constants appear to be valid and likely serve different purposes: one related to a snapshot path and the other to WebSocket frontend access.  
   - Neither change is inherently incorrect or redundant.  
   - The conflict is not due to overlapping code but due to Git's inability to determine that the additions are independent.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**  
   - The intention of `a` is to define a constant for a snapshot path, likely for saving or restoring some state.  
   - The intention of `b` is to define a constant for WebSocket frontend access, likely for configuration or routing purposes.  
   - Both changes are likely orthogonal and can coexist in the same file.

4. **Final decision:**  
   - Since both constants are valid and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to include both in the final file.  
   - No changes need to be made to either constant.  
   - The conflict is purely a Git artifact due to both branches adding content to an empty file.  
   - The resolution should simply combine both additions.
