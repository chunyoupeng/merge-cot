### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> return <WITH> throw)
<REPLACE> null <WITH> new)
<ADD> UnsupportedOperationException ( " Unsupported meta data : " + meta )


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline>
<DELETE> Long . valueOf
<ADD> long )
<DELETE> )
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the `base` version, the `default` case returns `null`.
   - In `a`, the `default` case is changed to throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` with a message.
   - In `b`, the `TTL` case is modified from `Long.valueOf(...)` to `(long) ...`, and the `default` case remains `null`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** The `default` case is changed from returning `null` to throwing an exception. This suggests that the developer in `a` believes that encountering an unsupported metadata type is an exceptional condition and should not be silently ignored.
   - **Change in `b`:** The `TTL` case is changed from using `Long.valueOf(...)` to a cast to `(long)`. This is a minor optimization or style change, likely to avoid unnecessary object creation. The `default` case remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention in `a`:** To enforce stricter error handling by throwing an exception when an unsupported metadata is encountered.
   - **Intention in `b`:** To improve performance or reduce object creation by using a cast instead of `Long.valueOf(...)`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `a` is more significant and represents a behavioral change in the code. If the system should treat unknown metadata as an error, this change is appropriate.
   - The change in `b` is a minor optimization and can be safely applied alongside the change in `a`.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should include both changes: throwing an exception in the `default` case and using a cast in the `TTL` case.

case TIMESTAMP:
    return element.getColumn().getTimestamp();
case TTL:
    return (long) element.getColumn().getTtl();
default:
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unsupported meta data: " + meta);
```

case TIMESTAMP:

                case TTL:
                    return (long) element.getColumn().getTtl();
                default:
