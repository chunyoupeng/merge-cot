### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();

RequestInterceptor requestInterceptor = new RequestInterceptor() {
            @Override
            public void intercept(RequestInterceptor.RequestFacade request) {
                if(ckSession != null)
                    request.addQueryParam("ckSession", ckSession);

            }

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` have added new code to a previously empty base.
   - Branch `a` introduces a `GsonBuilder` and registers a custom type adapter for `Map<String, DNKRecordField>`, using a `DNKRecordFieldDeserializer`.
   - Branch `b` introduces a `RequestInterceptor` that adds a query parameter `ckSession` to requests if `ckSession` is not null.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `GsonBuilder` in branch `a` is likely for custom JSON deserialization, which is a common use case when working with Gson. It is a self-contained block of code and does not interfere with the `RequestInterceptor` from branch `b`.
   - The `RequestInterceptor` in branch `b` is for adding a session token to requests, which is also a common use case in HTTP clients. It is also self-contained and does not interfere with the Gson configuration.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of branch `a` is to configure Gson to handle a specific type of deserialization.
   - The intention of branch `b` is to add session-based request interception for authentication or tracking purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and do not conflict with each other, the best resolution is to merge both changes into the final code.
   - The order of the code blocks may not matter, but it's good practice to keep related code together if possible. In this case, both are configuration blocks, so either order is acceptable.

```java
GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();
gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(new TypeToken<Map<String, DNKRecordField>>() {}.getType(), new DNKRecordFieldDeserializer());

RequestInterceptor requestInterceptor = new RequestInterceptor() {
    @Override
    public void intercept(RequestInterceptor.RequestFacade request) {
        if(ckSession != null)
            request.addQueryParam("ckSession", ckSession);
    }
};
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
GsonBuilder gsonBuilder = new GsonBuilder();
        gsonBuilder.registerTypeAdapter(new TypeToken<Map<String, DNKRecordField>>() {}.getType(), new DNKRecordFieldDeserializer());

        RequestInterceptor requestInterceptor = new RequestInterceptor() {
            @Override
            public void intercept(RequestInterceptor.RequestFacade request) {
                if(ckSession != null)
                    request.addQueryParam("ckSession", ckSession);

            }
        };
