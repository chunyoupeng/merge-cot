### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@Override
    public ServerSession getServerSession()
    {
        if (_session == null)
||||||| base
public ServerSession getServerSession()
    {
        if (_session == null)
=======
public ServerSession getServerSession() {
        if (_session == null) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> @ Override <newline>


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> {


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `a`, the method `getServerSession()` is annotated with `@Override`, and the method body uses a traditional style with a newline after the opening brace.
   - In `b`, the method body is modified to use curly braces `{}` on the same line as the method declaration, and a newline is deleted.
   - The base version uses a traditional style with a newline after the opening brace and no `@Override` annotation.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `@Override` annotation in `a` is a good practice when overriding a method, as it improves code clarity and helps catch errors during compilation.
   - The change in `b` to use curly braces on the same line is a stylistic choice and does not affect functionality. It may be intended to align with a different code formatting standard.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to explicitly indicate that the method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface.
   - The intention in `b` is likely to standardize the method formatting to a more compact style.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@Override` annotation should be retained because it is a meaningful and useful addition.
   - The formatting change in `b` can be incorporated by adjusting the brace style to match the compact format.
   - The final resolution should include both the `@Override` annotation and the compact brace style.
