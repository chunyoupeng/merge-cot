### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> ColumnRangeSelection <WITH> BatchColumnRangeSelection)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the parameter type from `ColumnRangeSelection` to `BatchColumnRangeSelection`.
   - **Branch `b`** added three newlines, which is a formatting change and does not affect the logic.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in **branch `a`** is a meaningful type change. It suggests that the method is now intended to work with a batched version of column range selection, likely for performance or scalability reasons.
   - The change in **branch `b`** is purely cosmetic and does not alter the behavior of the method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to improve the method's functionality by supporting batched operations.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to improve code readability or formatting, but the addition of three newlines is excessive and unnecessary.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in **branch `a`** is functionally important and should be retained.
   - The change in **branch `b`** is unnecessary and should be discarded.
   - The final method should use `BatchColumnRangeSelection` as the parameter type and retain the original formatting.
