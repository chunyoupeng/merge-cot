### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* @throws NotFoundException
	 *             If the activity does not exist
	 * @see javastrava.api.v3.service.ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Integer)
||||||| base
* @throws NotFoundException If the activity does not exist
	 * @see javastrava.api.v3.service.ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Integer)
=======
* @throws NotFoundException If the activity does not exist
	 * @see javastrava.api.v3.service.ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Long)
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> *


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Integer <WITH> Long)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the Javadoc for the method includes a `@see` tag referencing `ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Integer)`.
   - In `a`, the only change is the addition of an asterisk (`*`) at the beginning of the line containing the `@throws` tag. This is likely a formatting change to align the Javadoc style.
   - In `b`, the `@see` tag is updated to reference `ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Long)` instead of `Integer`. This is a functional change, indicating a change in the method's parameter type.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` is purely stylistic and does not affect the functionality of the code. It may be intended to improve Javadoc formatting consistency.
   - The change in `b` is functional and indicates that the method now expects a `Long` instead of an `Integer`. This is a significant change and likely reflects an actual update in the API.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to improve the visual formatting of the Javadoc.
   - The intention of `b` is to reflect a real change in the method's parameter type, likely due to an API update or refactoring.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The functional change in `b` is more significant and should be preserved, as it reflects an actual update in the method's behavior.
   - The formatting change in `a` can be applied on top of the updated Javadoc from `b` to maintain consistent style.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to use the `@see` tag from `b` and apply the formatting change from `a`.

```java
	 * @throws NotFoundException
	 *             If the activity does not exist
	 * @see javastrava.api.v3.service.ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Long)
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
* @throws NotFoundException
	 *             If the activity does not exist
	 * @see javastrava.api.v3.service.ActivityService#deleteActivityAsync(java.lang.Long)
