### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the `base` version, the Javadoc comments for the method parameters are written in a compact format with no indentation for the parameter descriptions.
   - In `a`, the Javadoc format is unchanged from the base — it's still compact with no indentation.
   - In `b`, the Javadoc format has been modified to include indentation for each parameter description (`sendTo`, `subject`, `status`, `changeDate`), which is a common style for improving readability in Javadoc.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` is no change — it preserves the original compact format.
   - The change in `b` improves readability by aligning the descriptions under each parameter, which is a common and accepted Javadoc style.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to maintain the original formatting.
   - The intention of `b` is to improve code readability and adhere to a more standard Javadoc formatting style.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b`'s change aligns with standard Javadoc formatting and improves readability without altering functionality, it should be preferred.
   - The resolution should adopt the formatting from `b` to ensure consistency and readability.
