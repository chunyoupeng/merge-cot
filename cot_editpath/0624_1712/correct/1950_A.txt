### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private String getRoleNameByOid(long roleOid) {
||||||| base
private String getRoleNameByOid(Long roleOid){
=======
private String getRoleNameByOid(Long roleOid) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> Long <WITH> long)



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the method declaration of `getRoleNameByOid`.
   - **Branch a** changed the parameter type from `Long` (object) to `long` (primitive).
   - **Branch b** did not change the parameter type but added a space after the parameter type in the method declaration (from `Long roleOid)` to `Long roleOid)`).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change:** Changing `Long` to `long` is a significant change. It affects the method's behavior by making it incompatible with `null` values. This might be intentional if the method is expected to always receive a valid, non-null `roleOid`.
   - **Branch b's change:** The addition of a space is purely a formatting change and does not affect the logic or behavior of the method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** Likely to optimize performance or enforce non-null values by using the primitive type `long`.
   - **Branch b's intention:** Likely to improve code formatting consistency.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The use of `long` (primitive) from branch a should be kept if the method is expected to always receive a valid, non-null value.
   - The formatting change from branch b (adding a space) is minor and can be safely applied without affecting functionality.
   - Therefore, the final method declaration should use `long` and include the space for formatting consistency.
