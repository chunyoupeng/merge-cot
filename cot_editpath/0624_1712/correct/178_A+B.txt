### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
cb.onFailure(new InsertException(InsertException.CANCELLED), this, container, context);
||||||| base
cb.onFailure(new InsertException(InsertException.CANCELLED), this);
=======
if(freeData)
			data.free();
		cb.onFailure(new InsertException(InsertException.CANCELLED), this);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , container , context


## From base to b
<ADD> if ( freeData ) <newline> data . free ( ) ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the parameters `container` and `context` to the `cb.onFailure(...)` call.
   - **Branch `b`** added a conditional block `if (freeData) data.free();` before the `cb.onFailure(...)` call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** appears to be adding additional context or dependencies to the failure callback, which might be necessary for error handling or logging.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces a resource cleanup step (`data.free()`) that is conditional on `freeData`, which suggests a need to manage resources before triggering the failure callback.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to provide more context to the failure callback for better error handling or debugging.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to ensure that a resource (`data`) is properly released before the failure is reported, to avoid resource leaks.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are logically independent and serve different purposes: one is about resource cleanup, and the other is about enhancing the failure callback.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both changes: the conditional cleanup from `b` and the additional parameters from `a`.
   - The order should be: first perform the cleanup (if needed), then call the failure callback with the additional parameters.

```java
if (freeData)
    data.free();
cb.onFailure(new InsertException(InsertException.CANCELLED), this, container, context);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
if(freeData)
			data.free();
		cb.onFailure(new InsertException(InsertException.CANCELLED), this, container, context);
