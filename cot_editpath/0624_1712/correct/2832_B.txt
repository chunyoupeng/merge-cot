### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
import com.apollocurrency.aplwallet.apl.util.Constants;
=======
import com.apollocurrency.aplwallet.apl.core.db.fulltext.FullTextSearchService;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<REPLACE> util <WITH> core)
<REPLACE> Constants <WITH> db)
<ADD> . fulltext . FullTextSearchService


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base file originally had the import: `import com.apollocurrency.aplwallet.apl.util.Constants;`.
   - Branch `a` completely removed all content from the base, including this import.
   - Branch `b` modified the import by:
     - Replacing `util` with `core`.
     - Replacing `Constants` with `db`.
     - Adding `.fulltext.FullTextSearchService` to the import path.
     - Resulting in the import: `import com.apollocurrency.aplwallet.apl.core.db.fulltext.FullTextSearchService;`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** removed all content, which suggests it might be a complete rewrite or deletion of the file. This is a destructive change and does not preserve any of the original logic.
   - **Branch `b`** made a specific and meaningful change to the import statement, likely to use a different class (`FullTextSearchService`) from a different package. This change is non-destructive and adds functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be removing the file or its content entirely, possibly for refactoring or removing unused code.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely adding or switching to a new feature or dependency related to full-text search functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` removed all content, it is not preserving the import or any other logic from the base.
   - Branch `b` is making a specific and meaningful addition to the file.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the import from branch `b` and discard the destructive change from branch `a`.
