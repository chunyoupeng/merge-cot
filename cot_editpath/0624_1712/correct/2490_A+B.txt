### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

@Test
    public void getAllPsd2Support() {
        //When:
        Boolean actualResponse = aspspProfileService.isAllPsd2Support();

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two test methods:
     - `a` introduced a test method `getAllPsd2Support()` that tests the method `isAllPsd2Support()` on the `aspspProfileService`.
     - `b` introduced a test method `isBankOfferedConsentSupport()` that tests the method `isBankOfferedConsentSupport()` on the same service.
   - Both methods are in the same class and test different functionalities of the `aspspProfileService`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are valid and test different features of the service.
   - There is no overlap in the functionality being tested.
   - Both methods follow the same test structure (When-Then), and the variable names are consistent with the method names.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to verify the behavior of `isAllPsd2Support()`, which likely relates to overall PSD2 compliance.
   - The intention of `b` is to verify the behavior of `isBankOfferedConsentSupport()`, which likely relates to a specific feature of consent offered by the bank.
   - Both changes are additive and do not interfere with each other.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both test methods are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to keep both methods in the final code.
   - No modification is needed to either method.
   - The code should be merged by including both test methods in the same class.

@Test
public void getAllPsd2Support() {
    //When:
    Boolean actualResponse = aspspProfileService.isAllPsd2Support();

    //Then:
    assertThat(actualResponse).isEqualTo(ALL_PSD_2_SUPPORT);
}

@Test
public void isBankOfferedConsentSupport() {
    //When
    boolean actualResponse = aspspProfileService.isBankOfferedConsentSupport();

    //Then
    assertThat(actualResponse).isEqualTo(BANK_OFFERED_CONSENT_SUPPORT);
}
