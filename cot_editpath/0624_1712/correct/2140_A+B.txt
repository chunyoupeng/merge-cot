### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
PYRAMID_PLUNDER_SARCO_OPEN(2362),
	PYRAMID_PLUNDER_CHEST_OPEN(2363),
||||||| base

=======
PYRAMID_PLUNDER_ROOM_LOCATION(2365),
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a list of constants or enums, likely representing different states or locations in a game or application.
   - In branch `a`, the constant `PYRAMID_PLUNDER_SARCO_OPEN(2362)` is followed by `PYRAMID_PLUNDER_CHEST_OPEN(2363)`.
   - In branch `b`, the constant `PYRAMID_PLUNDER_ROOM_LOCATION(2365)` is added.
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding new constants independently.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding new constants with unique IDs, which suggests they are extending the same enum or list with different features.
   - `a` is adding features related to "sarcophagus" and "chest" states.
   - `b` is adding a feature related to a "room location".
   - Since the IDs are unique and the constants represent different functionalities, there is no overlap or conflict in the values themselves.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to add game states for opening a sarcophagus and a chest.
   - The intention in `b` is to add a game state for a room location.
   - These are likely separate features or parts of the game logic, and the constants are meant to be part of the same enum or list.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the constants are unique and represent different functionalities, they can all be merged into the same list.
   - The correct resolution is to combine all three constants in the order they appear in the branches, ensuring the list is coherent and maintains the order of insertion.
