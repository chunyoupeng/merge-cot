### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@Order(21)
	@ExportProperty(ContactDto.CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE_DETAILS)
||||||| base
@Order(21)
	@ExportProperty(ContactDto.CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE)
=======
@Order(22)
	@ExportProperty(ContactDto.CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE)
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE <WITH> CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE_DETAILS)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> 21 <WITH> 22)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the code is:
     ```java
     @Order(21)
         @ExportProperty(ContactDto.CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE)
     ```
   - In `a`, the `@ExportProperty` value is changed from `CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE` to `CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE_DETAILS`.
   - In `b`, the `@Order` value is changed from `21` to `22`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** This change introduces a new property (`CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE_DETAILS`) for export. It likely reflects a new field or detail that needs to be exported in the `ContactDto`.
   - **Change in `b`:** This change increases the order from `21` to `22`, which could be to accommodate a new field or to reorganize the export order.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention of `a`:** To include a more detailed source information in the export.
   - **Intention of `b`:** To adjust the order of the export fields, possibly to make room for a new field or to reorganize the sequence.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two changes are orthogonal: one modifies the property name, the other modifies the order.
   - Since `a` introduces a new property (`CONTACT_IDENTIFICATION_SOURCE_DETAILS`), it is likely that the order change in `b` is to accommodate this new property.
   - Therefore, we should apply both changes: use the updated property name from `a` and the updated order from `b`.
