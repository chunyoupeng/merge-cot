### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import de.rub.nds.tlsattacker.core.constants.RunningModeType;
||||||| base

=======
import de.rub.nds.tlsattacker.core.constants.PskKeyExchangeMode;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statement. 
   - `a` added the import: `import de.rub.nds.tlsattacker.core.constants.RunningModeType;`
   - `b` added the import: `import de.rub.nds.tlsattacker.core.constants.PskKeyExchangeMode;`
   - The base is empty, so both `a` and `b` added their own imports independently.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `RunningModeType` and `PskKeyExchangeMode` are likely used in the code for different purposes.
   - `RunningModeType` might be used to define the mode in which the TLS attacker operates (e.g., client, server, etc.).
   - `PskKeyExchangeMode` likely defines how pre-shared keys are used in the key exchange process.
   - Both imports are logically distinct and serve different functionalities.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to support functionality related to running modes.
   - The intention of `b` is to support functionality related to PSK key exchange modes.
   - Neither branch is overwriting the other; they are adding distinct imports.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both imports are distinct and serve different purposes, both should be retained.
   - The resolution is to include both import statements in the final merged code.
