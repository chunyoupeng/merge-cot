### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private static final String ALTER_CREATE_SMS_TABLE_FOR_THUMBNAIL_BLOB_KEY = "ALTER TABLE " + SMS + " ADD COLUMN " + THUMBNAIL_BLOB_KEY + " varchar(2000)";
||||||| base

private static final String ALTER_CHANNEL_TABLE_FOR_AL_CATEGORY_COLUMN = "ALTER TABLE " + CHANNEL + " ADD COLUMN " + AL_CATEGORY + " VARCHAR(2000)";
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two different `ALTER TABLE` statements:
     - `a` adds a column `THUMBNAIL_BLOB_KEY` of type `varchar(2000)` to the `SMS` table.
     - `b` adds a column `AL_CATEGORY` of type `VARCHAR(2000)` to the `CHANNEL` table.
   - Both changes are entirely new and do not overlap in terms of table or column names.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s change introduces a new column to the `SMS` table, likely to store thumbnail blob keys for SMS-related data.
   - `b`'s change introduces a new column to the `CHANNEL` table, likely to store a category for a channel.
   - Both changes are valid and independent of each other.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to enhance the `SMS` table with a new field for thumbnail blob keys.
   - The intention of `b` is to enhance the `CHANNEL` table with a new field for category information.
   - There is no overlap in functionality or data structure, and both changes are additive.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and do not conflict with each other, the correct resolution is to include both statements in the final code.
   - No modification is needed to either statement.
   - The final code should reflect both changes.
