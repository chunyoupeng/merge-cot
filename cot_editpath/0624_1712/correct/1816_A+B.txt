### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> final Session session , <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> , boolean insertingRow


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new parameter `final Session session` to the method signature and inserted a newline after the parameter list.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new parameter `boolean insertingRow` to the method signature.
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new parameter to the method, but at different positions in the parameter list.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `final Session session` is likely to provide access to a session object within the method. The `final` keyword indicates that the session should not be reassigned, which is a good practice for clarity and immutability.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `boolean insertingRow` introduces a flag to indicate whether the method is being used for inserting a row. This is a logical addition for conditional behavior within the method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To provide access to a session object for potential session-specific operations.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To allow the method to behave differently depending on whether a row is being inserted.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both parameters are logically distinct and serve different purposes. Therefore, both should be included in the final method signature.
   - The order of the parameters should be preserved as in branch `a` (with `Session session` first), followed by `insertingRow` from branch `b`.
   - The newline formatting from branch `a` should be retained for consistency in code style.
