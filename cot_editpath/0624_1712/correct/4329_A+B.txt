### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Assert.assertTrue(requestResource.getActiveRequests(false, false, false, 10).isEmpty());
||||||| base
Assert.assertTrue(requestResource.getActiveRequests(false).isEmpty());
=======
Assert.assertTrue(requestResource.getActiveRequests(singularityUser, false).isEmpty());
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , false , false , 10


## From base to b
<ADD> singularityUser ,


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method call is: `requestResource.getActiveRequests(false).isEmpty()`.
   - In branch `a`, the method call is modified to: `requestResource.getActiveRequests(false, false, false, 10).isEmpty()`. This adds four parameters: three `false` values and a `10`.
   - In branch `b`, the method call is modified to: `requestResource.getActiveRequests(singularityUser, false).isEmpty()`. This adds two parameters: `singularityUser` and a `false`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces three additional `false` boolean parameters and a `10` (likely an integer). This suggests that the method `getActiveRequests` has been extended to accept more parameters, possibly for filtering or pagination.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces a `singularityUser` parameter, which is likely a user object or identifier. This suggests that the method now supports filtering active requests by a specific user.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be adding more granular control over the filtering of active requests, possibly for sorting, limiting, or additional boolean flags.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding user-specific filtering, which is a common and meaningful enhancement in systems where user context matters.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method `getActiveRequests` appears to have evolved to accept multiple optional parameters. The correct resolution should include both the `singularityUser` and the additional parameters from `a` in the correct order.
   - Since `singularityUser` is likely the first parameter (as it is a user object), it should be placed before the additional boolean and integer parameters.
   - The final method call should be: `requestResource.getActiveRequests(singularityUser, false, false, false, 10).isEmpty();`

```java
Assert.assertTrue(requestResource.getActiveRequests(singularityUser, false, false, false, 10).isEmpty());
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
Assert.assertTrue(requestResource.getActiveRequests(singularityUser, false, false, false, 10).isEmpty());
