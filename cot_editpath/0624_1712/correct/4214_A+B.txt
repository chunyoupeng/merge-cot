### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
popups.showError(R.string.sign_in_unsuccessful);
    viewModel.onSignedOut(getCurrentNavDestinationId());
||||||| base
EphemeralPopups.showError(this, R.string.sign_in_unsuccessful);
    viewModel.onSignedOut(getCurrentNavDestinationId());
=======
EphemeralPopups.showError(this, R.string.sign_in_unsuccessful);
    viewModel.onSignedOut();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> EphemeralPopups <WITH> popups)
<DELETE> this ,


## From base to b
<DELETE> getCurrentNavDestinationId ( )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is: `EphemeralPopups.showError(this, R.string.sign_in_unsuccessful);`
   - In branch `a`, it is changed to: `popups.showError(R.string.sign_in_unsuccessful);`
     - This removes `EphemeralPopups` and replaces it with `popups`, and also removes the `this` argument.
   - In branch `b`, the line is unchanged, but the next line is changed from `viewModel.onSignedOut(getCurrentNavDestinationId());` to `viewModel.onSignedOut();`
     - This removes the `getCurrentNavDestinationId()` call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change to `popups.showError(...)`**:
     - This suggests that `popups` is a reference to `EphemeralPopups`, possibly a local or injected variable.
     - Removing `this` implies that the `showError` method no longer requires the `this` context, which may be valid if the method signature has changed.
   - **Branch `b`'s change to `viewModel.onSignedOut()`**:
     - This implies that the `onSignedOut` method no longer requires the `getCurrentNavDestinationId()` parameter.
     - This could be due to a refactoring where the destination ID is now handled internally by the `viewModel`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely refactored the code to use a local or injected `popups` object instead of the full class name `EphemeralPopups`, and removed `this` because the method no longer requires it.
   - **Branch `b`** likely refactored the `onSignedOut` method to no longer require the `getCurrentNavDestinationId()` parameter, possibly moving that logic into the `viewModel`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and likely reflect different refactorings.
   - The `popups.showError(...)` from `a` is a cleaner and more modern way to reference the object if `popups` is a valid reference.
   - The `viewModel.onSignedOut()` from `b` is also a valid refactor if the method no longer needs the destination ID.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both changes: use `popups.showError(...)` and `viewModel.onSignedOut()` without the destination ID.
