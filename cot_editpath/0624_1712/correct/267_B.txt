### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Value ( " $ { server . ajp . secret - required : true } " ) <newline> private String ajpSecretRequired ; <newline> <newline> @ Value ( " $ { server . ajp . secret : } " ) <newline> private String ajpSecret ; <newline> <newline> @ Value ( " $ { server . ajp . address : 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 } " ) <newline> private String ajpAddress ; <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed all content from the base, which means the `@Bean` method `sessionRegistry()` was deleted.
   - **Branch `b`** added three new `@Value` fields (`ajpSecretRequired`, `ajpSecret`, `ajpAddress`) and kept the `@Bean` method `sessionRegistry()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing the `sessionRegistry()` bean might be intentional if the application no longer needs it. However, this is a significant and potentially destructive change.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding configuration properties for AJP (Apache JServ Protocol) is a common practice for configuring external integrations (e.g., with Apache Tomcat). These properties are likely needed for the application to function correctly in a production or integration environment.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** It seems to be removing the `SessionRegistry` bean, possibly because it is no longer used or is being replaced by another mechanism.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** It is adding configuration for AJP, which is likely for enabling secure communication or integration with a load balancer or reverse proxy.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@Bean` method `sessionRegistry()` is still valid and useful in many Spring applications, especially those using Spring Security or session management. Removing it entirely (as in branch `a`) is likely an overreach unless there is a clear reason to do so.
   - The configuration properties added in branch `b` are non-intrusive and provide flexibility for external configuration.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to **keep the `@Bean` method from branch `b`** and **add the configuration properties from branch `b`**.

# Final Resolution
```java
@Value("${server.ajp.secret-required:true}")
private String ajpSecretRequired;

@Value("${server.ajp.secret:}")
private String ajpSecret;

@Value("${server.ajp.address:127.0.0.1}")
private String ajpAddress;

@Bean
public SessionRegistry sessionRegistry()
{
    return new SessionRegistryImpl();
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
@Value("${server.ajp.secret-required:true}")
    private String ajpSecretRequired;

    @Value("${server.ajp.secret:}")
    private String ajpSecret;

    @Value("${server.ajp.address:127.0.0.1}")
    private String ajpAddress;

    @Bean
    public SessionRegistry sessionRegistry()
    {
        return new SessionRegistryImpl();
    }
