### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> NamedCurve <WITH> NamedGroup)


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> import de . rub . nds . tlsattacker . core . protocol . handler . PskEcDheServerKeyExchangeHandler ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the import is `NamedCurve` and the import for `PskEcDheServerKeyExchangeHandler` is present.
   - In branch `a`, `NamedCurve` is replaced with `NamedGroup`, and the import for `PskEcDheServerKeyExchangeHandler` remains.
   - In branch `b`, the import for `PskEcDheServerKeyExchangeHandler` is deleted, but `NamedCurve` remains.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change (`NamedCurve` → `NamedGroup`)**:
     - This likely reflects a codebase update where `NamedGroup` is the newer or preferred term over `NamedCurve`.
     - Keeping this change is likely necessary for correctness if the rest of the codebase uses `NamedGroup`.
   - **Branch `b`'s change (removing the import for `PskEcDheServerKeyExchangeHandler`)**:
     - This could indicate that the class is no longer used in this file.
     - However, if the class is still referenced in the code, removing the import would cause a compilation error.
     - If the class is not used, the import is unnecessary and can be safely removed.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely modernizing the code to use `NamedGroup`, which may be the updated naming convention in the library.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely cleaning up unused imports, which is a good practice for code readability and maintainability.

4. **Final decision:**
   - We should **keep the change from `a`** (`NamedCurve` → `NamedGroup`) because it reflects a necessary update for correctness.
   - We should **keep the change from `b`** (removing the import for `PskEcDheServerKeyExchangeHandler`) **only if** the class is not used in the file. If it is used, the import should remain.
   - Since the conflict only involves the import line and not the usage of the class, we assume the class is not used and can be safely removed.
