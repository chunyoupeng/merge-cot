### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

ResourcePost resourcePost = new ResourcePost(resourceRegistry, typeParser, OBJECT_MAPPER);
        ResourceResponse taskResponse = resourcePost.handle(taskPath, new QueryParams(), newTaskBody);
||||||| base
ResourcePost resourcePost = new ResourcePost(resourceRegistry, typeParser, OBJECT_MAPPER);
        ResourceResponse taskResponse = resourcePost.handle(taskPath, new RequestParams(new ObjectMapper()), newTaskBody);

ResourcePost resourcePost = new ResourcePost(resourceRegistry, typeParser, objectMapper);
        ResourceResponse taskResponse = resourcePost.handle(taskPath, new RequestParams(new ObjectMapper()), null, newTaskBody);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> RequestParams <WITH> QueryParams)
<DELETE> new ObjectMapper ( )


## From base to b
<REPLACE> OBJECT_MAPPER <WITH> objectMapper)
<ADD> null ,


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `RequestParams(new ObjectMapper())` with `QueryParams()`.
     - Removed `new ObjectMapper()` from the constructor call.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced `OBJECT_MAPPER` with `objectMapper`.
     - Added an extra `null` argument in the `handle` method call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change from `RequestParams` to `QueryParams` suggests a shift in how parameters are handled, possibly to simplify or adapt to a new API design.
     - Removing `new ObjectMapper()` implies that the default or already-initialized `OBJECT_MAPPER` is sufficient, which could be a performance or consistency improvement.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replacing `OBJECT_MAPPER` with `objectMapper` might indicate a move from a static constant to an instance variable, which could be for better encapsulation or flexibility.
     - Adding `null` as an argument suggests that the `handle` method now expects an additional parameter, possibly for optional data or a new feature.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to simplify the parameter handling by switching to `QueryParams` and removing unnecessary object creation.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to refactor the code to use a non-static `objectMapper` and introduce a new parameter to the `handle` method.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `QueryParams` from `a` is a cleaner and more modern approach to parameter handling.
   - The `objectMapper` from `b` is a better encapsulation choice than the static `OBJECT_MAPPER`.
   - The `null` argument from `b` should be included to support the new method signature.
   - The `newTaskBody` should be retained as the final argument.

   Therefore, the resolution should combine the `QueryParams` from `a`, the `objectMapper` from `b`, and the `null` argument from `b`.
