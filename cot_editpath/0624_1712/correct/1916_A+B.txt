### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
QueryToolChestWarehouse warehouse,
      RetryQueryRunnerConfig retryConfig
||||||| base
QueryToolChestWarehouse warehouse
=======
QueryToolChestWarehouse warehouse,
      ObjectMapper objectMapper
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , <newline> RetryQueryRunnerConfig retryConfig


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> ObjectMapper objectMapper


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, the code has: `QueryToolChestWarehouse warehouse`
   - In branch `a`, it adds: `, RetryQueryRunnerConfig retryConfig`
   - In branch `b`, it adds: `, ObjectMapper objectMapper`
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new parameter to the same line, but with different types and names.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` added a `RetryQueryRunnerConfig` parameter, likely to support retry logic in the method.
   - Branch `b` added an `ObjectMapper` parameter, likely to support JSON serialization/deserialization.
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. There is no overlap or contradiction in the parameters themselves.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to introduce retry configuration for query execution.
   - The intention of `b` is to introduce a JSON mapper for data transformation.
   - These are orthogonal concerns and can coexist in the same method signature.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both parameters are needed for different functionalities, the correct resolution is to include both in the final code.
   - The order of the parameters should be preserved as per the original branches, or adjusted for readability if needed.
   - No code style or correctness issues are apparent.
