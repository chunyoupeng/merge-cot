### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> 23 <WITH> 21)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> 64 <WITH> 41)
<ADD> , 6 , Messages . ERROR , Messages . STATEMENTS ) ; <newline> addExpectedMsg ( 42


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, we have:
     ```java
     addExpectedMsg(40, 23, Messages.ERROR, Messages.STATEMENTS);
     addExpectedMsg(64, 2, Messages.ERROR, Messages.STATEMENTS);
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the second argument of the first `addExpectedMsg` call is changed from `23` to `21`.
   - In branch `b`, the first argument of the second `addExpectedMsg` call is changed from `64` to `41`, and two new lines are added:
     ```java
     addExpectedMsg(41, 6, Messages.ERROR, Messages.STATEMENTS);
     addExpectedMsg(42, 2, Messages.ERROR, Messages.STATEMENTS);
     ```
   - The conflict arises because both branches modify the same base code in different ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** It modifies the second argument of the first `addExpectedMsg` call from `23` to `21`. This is a small, localized change.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** It modifies the first argument of the second `addExpectedMsg` call from `64` to `41`, and adds two new `addExpectedMsg` calls. This is a more substantial change, adding new test cases or error conditions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** It seems to be adjusting the expected error position in the first `addExpectedMsg` call. This could be due to a code change that shifted the line/column number of an error.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** It appears to be adding more detailed error checking by introducing two new expected error messages at different positions. This suggests an expansion of test coverage or error validation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are modifying the same base code in different ways, we need to merge both changes.
   - The change from `a` (changing `23` to `21`) should be applied to the first `addExpectedMsg` call.
   - The changes from `b` (changing `64` to `41` and adding two new `addExpectedMsg` calls) should also be included.
   - The result will be a combination of both sets of changes, ensuring that all expected error messages are included with the updated parameters.
