### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> import static mil . nga . giat . data . elasticsearch . ElasticLayerConfiguration . NESTED ;


## From base to b
<REPLACE> static <WITH> org)
<DELETE> mil

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the import: `import static mil.nga.giat.data.elasticsearch.ElasticLayerConfiguration.NESTED;`.
   - **Branch `b`** removed the `mil.nga.giat.data.elasticsearch.ElasticLayerConfiguration` prefix and replaced it with `org.apache.lucene.queryparser.xml.FilterBuilder`. It also removed the `ANALYZED` import and kept the `DATE_FORMAT` import.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** The addition of `NESTED` is likely for using a static constant related to Elasticsearch configuration. It's a small, additive change that doesn't interfere with the rest of the code.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** This is a more significant transformation. It appears to be refactoring the code to use a different class (`FilterBuilder`) from a different package (`org.apache.lucene.queryparser.xml`). This suggests a shift in the purpose of the file, possibly from Elasticsearch configuration to Lucene query parsing.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely extending or enhancing the Elasticsearch-related functionality by adding a new constant.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely refactoring the code to use Lucene's `FilterBuilder`, indicating a move away from Elasticsearch configuration to Lucene query parsing.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the two branches are modifying the same import statement in fundamentally different ways, it's unlikely they can be merged without deeper context.
   - If the file is intended to remain focused on Elasticsearch configuration, then `a`'s change should be kept and `b`'s change should be discarded.
   - If the file is being refactored to use Lucene's `FilterBuilder`, then `b`'s change should be kept and `a`'s change should be discarded.
   - Given the lack of context, the safer assumption is to preserve the original Elasticsearch configuration intent and keep `a`'s addition of `NESTED`.
