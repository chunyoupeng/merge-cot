### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` have added the same line of code:
     ```java
     private static final Map<Class, Set<Transformation<AbstractNode>>> globalEntityCreationTransformationMap = new LinkedHashMap<Class, Set<Transformation<AbstractNode>>>();
     ```
   - However, branch `b` also adds an additional line:
     ```java
     private static final Map<Long, FrameworkException> exceptionMap = new LinkedHashMap<Long, FrameworkException>();
     ```
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding new code independently.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a map for tracking transformations related to entity creation. This is likely part of a system for managing transformations on abstract nodes.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces the same transformation map as in `a`, plus an additional map for tracking exceptions by ID. This suggests `b` is adding error-handling functionality alongside the transformation logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to add transformation logic for entities.
   - The intention of `b` is to add both transformation logic and exception tracking, likely for debugging or logging purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches add the same transformation map, it is safe to include it once.
   - The exception map from `b` is a new and useful addition that does not conflict with the transformation logic from `a`.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both lines of code from `b`, as it incorporates the changes from `a` and adds an extra feature.
