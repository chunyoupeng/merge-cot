### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added new static synchronized lookup methods for different services.
   - Branch `a` added a method `lookupCurrencyMintService()` for `CurrencyMintService`.
   - Branch `b` added multiple methods for `AssetTransferService`, `CurrencyExchangeOfferFacade`, `ExchangeRequestService`, and `CurrencyTransferService`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding similar patterns of lazy-initialized, synchronized lookup methods for different services.
   - The pattern is consistent: a static synchronized method that lazily initializes a service using CDI.
   - There is no overlap in the service types being added (`CurrencyMintService` is unique to `a`, while the others are unique to `b`).
   - No conflicting logic or overlapping code is present.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both branches is to provide a centralized and thread-safe way to lazily initialize and retrieve CDI services.
   - The services added by each branch are distinct and serve different purposes in the application.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the changes are additive and do not conflict with each other, the best resolution is to merge both sets of methods.
   - The resulting code will include all the lookup methods from both branches, maintaining the consistent pattern and thread-safe lazy initialization.
   - No modifications are needed to either method, as they are all logically and stylistically consistent.
