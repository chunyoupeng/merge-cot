### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** modifies the SQL query by renaming the column aliases from `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, and `avg` to `myCount`, `mySum`, `myMin`, `myMax`, and `myAvg`. Additionally, it adds a `cast(avg(1.0 * a_i) as float)` to ensure the average is a float.
   - **Branch b** changes the way the parameters are initialized. Instead of using `new HashMap()` and `params.put(...)`, it uses a helper method `mapParams(...)` to create the parameter map in a more concise and readable way.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's changes** are focused on the SQL query itself. The renaming of column aliases is likely for clarity or to avoid naming conflicts in the application. The `cast(avg(1.0 * a_i) as float)` ensures the average is computed as a float, which is a more precise and explicit approach.
   - **Branch b's changes** are about improving code style and readability by using a helper method to construct the parameter map. This is a good practice and makes the code more maintainable.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** aims to improve the clarity of the SQL query output by renaming the columns and ensuring the average is a float.
   - **Branch b** aims to improve the code structure by using a more concise and readable method for parameter initialization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are beneficial and serve different purposes. The SQL query changes from **a** improve the clarity and correctness of the query output, while the code structure changes from **b** improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
   - The conflict arises because **a** modifies the SQL query string directly, while **b** changes the way the parameters are initialized. These changes can be combined by using the `mapParams` method from **b** and incorporating the SQL query from **a** into it.
   - The final resolution should use the `mapParams` method to initialize the parameters and include the updated SQL query from **a**.

# Final Resolution
```java
sParams = mapParams(CommonParams.QT, "/sql",
      "stmt", "select count(*) as myCount, sum(a_i) as mySum, min(a_i) as myMin, max(a_i) as myMax, " +
        "cast(avg(1.0 * a_i) as float) as myAvg, sum(a_f), min(a_f), max(a_f), avg(a_f) from collection1");
```

sParams = mapParams(CommonParams.QT, "/sql",
        "stmt", "select count(*) as myCount, sum(a_i) as mySum, min(a_i) as myMin, max(a_i) as myMax, " +
        "cast(avg(1.0 * a_i) as float) as myAvg, sum(a_f), min(a_f), max(a_f), avg(a_f) from collection1");
