### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
/**************************** TAGS AND CUSTOM FIELDS ******************************/
||||||| base
/****************************      TAGS     ******************************/
=======
/*
     * *************************      CUSTOM FIELDS     *****************************
     */
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> AND CUSTOM FIELDS


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline>
<REPLACE> * <WITH> CUSTOM)
<REPLACE> * <WITH> FIELDS)
<DELETE> TAGS
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, the comment line is: `/****************************      TAGS     ******************************/`
   - In branch `a`, it is changed to: `/**************************** TAGS AND CUSTOM FIELDS ******************************/`
     - This adds "AND CUSTOM FIELDS" to the original "TAGS".
   - In branch `b`, the line is changed to:
     - A new comment line is added: `/* * *************************      CUSTOM FIELDS     ***************************** */`
     - The word "TAGS" is removed.
     - The word "TAGS" is replaced with "CUSTOM".
     - The word "TAGS" is replaced with "FIELDS".
     - A newline is added.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - It expands the original comment to include both "TAGS" and "CUSTOM FIELDS".
     - This suggests an intention to keep the original section (TAGS) and add a new one (CUSTOM FIELDS).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - It removes "TAGS" entirely and replaces it with "CUSTOM FIELDS".
     - This suggests an intention to completely replace the section with a new one (CUSTOM FIELDS).
     - The formatting is also changed, with a new comment line and a newline added.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to maintain the existing section on TAGS and introduce a new section on CUSTOM FIELDS.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to remove the TAGS section and focus solely on CUSTOM FIELDS, possibly deprecating or removing the old section.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two branches have conflicting intentions: one wants to keep TAGS and add CUSTOM FIELDS, while the other wants to remove TAGS and focus on CUSTOM FIELDS.
   - To resolve this, we can merge the intentions by removing the original TAGS section and introducing a new section for CUSTOM FIELDS, as this aligns with the direction of branch `b` while acknowledging the intent of branch `a` to introduce CUSTOM FIELDS.
   - We will adopt the formatting from branch `b` for consistency and clarity.
