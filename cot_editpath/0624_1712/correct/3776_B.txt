### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
else
											results.addResult(iStmt.getInvokeExpr(),
													source.getSource());
||||||| base
else
											results.addResult(iStmt.getInvokeExpr(),
													source.getSource());
=======
else
											results.addResult(iStmt.getInvokeExpr(), iStmt,
													source.getSource(), source.getSourceContext());
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> iStmt , , source . getSourceContext ( )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code has the line:
     ```java
     results.addResult(iStmt.getInvokeExpr(), source.getSource());
     ```
   - Branch `a` has not changed this line (it is identical to the base).
   - Branch `b` has modified this line by adding two additional arguments: `iStmt` and `source.getSourceContext()`. The new line in `b` is:
     ```java
     results.addResult(iStmt.getInvokeExpr(), iStmt, source.getSource(), source.getSourceContext());
     ```

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** No change was made, so there is no new logic or intention to consider.
   - **Branch `b`:** The addition of `iStmt` and `source.getSourceContext()` suggests that the `addResult` method in `results` has been updated to accept more parameters. This likely reflects an enhancement in functionality, such as providing more context or metadata when adding a result.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** No intention to change the behavior of the method call.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to pass more detailed information to the `addResult` method, possibly to support richer logging, debugging, or data tracking.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` has not changed the line, the conflict is essentially between the base and branch `b`.
   - The change in branch `b` appears to be an enhancement that adds more context to the `addResult` call. If the `addResult` method in the current codebase supports these additional parameters, then this change should be retained.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the updated line from branch `b`.
