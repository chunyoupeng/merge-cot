### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different fields added in branches `a` and `b`, both relative to an empty base.
   - Branch `a` added a field `classpathExtensions` of type `List<Configuration>`, which is related to configuring the classpath for Flyway tasks.
   - Branch `b` added a field `errorHandlers` of type `String[]`, which is related to custom error handling in Flyway.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. `classpathExtensions` is for classpath configuration, while `errorHandlers` is for custom error handling.
   - Neither change overlaps with the other in terms of functionality or code structure.
   - Since the base was empty, there is no original code to preserve or conflict with.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to allow users to customize the classpath for Flyway tasks.
   - The intention of `b` is to allow users to define custom error handlers for Flyway.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are non-conflicting and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both fields into the final code.
   - This preserves the functionality and intentions of both branches without any loss.
