### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline>
<REPLACE> de <WITH> hashengineering)
<REPLACE> schildbach <WITH> darkcoin)
<REPLACE> wallet_test <WITH> wallet)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> com <WITH> android)
<DELETE> . actionbarsherlock . app . ActionBar ; <newline> import com . actionbarsherlock
<REPLACE> com <WITH> android)
<DELETE> . actionbarsherlock <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaces `de.schildbach.wallet_test.R` with `hashengineering.darkcoin.wallet.R`.
     - Keeps the `com.actionbarsherlock` imports.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Replaces `com.actionbarsherlock` imports with `android.view` imports.
     - Keeps `de.schildbach.wallet_test.R`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The replacement of `R` (resource) to `hashengineering.darkcoin.wallet.R` suggests a move to a new package or project structure.
     - Retaining `com.actionbarsherlock` imports implies continued use of the ActionBarSherlock library.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Replacing `com.actionbarsherlock` with `android.view` suggests a migration away from ActionBarSherlock to native Android APIs.
     - Keeping `de.schildbach.wallet_test.R` implies no change in resource package.

3. **Understand the intention:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely represents a fork or a new project that uses a different resource package and continues using ActionBarSherlock.
   - **Branch `b`** likely represents a modernization or migration to native Android APIs, removing the need for ActionBarSherlock.

4. **Final decision:**
   - If the project is moving to native Android APIs (as in `b`), then `com.actionbarsherlock` should be removed and `android.view` used instead.
   - If the project is moving to a new package structure (as in `a`), then `hashengineering.darkcoin.wallet.R` should be used.
   - Since both branches are making incompatible changes, the resolution must choose one direction or the other.
   - Assuming the project is modernizing and moving away from ActionBarSherlock, the resolution should favor `b`'s changes, but also adopt the new resource package from `a`.
