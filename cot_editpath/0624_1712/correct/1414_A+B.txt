### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

assertThat(contentOf(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "curl-request.adoc")))

				.contains("api.example.com");

assertThat(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "curl-request.adoc"))

		assertThat(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "http-request.adoc")).has(contentContaining("api.example.com"));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ( contentOf )
<REPLACE> has <WITH> contains)
<DELETE> ( contentContaining )
<ADD> ( contentOf )
<REPLACE> has <WITH> contains)
<DELETE> ( contentContaining )


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the code uses `has(contentContaining(...))` to assert that a file contains certain content.
   - In branch `a`, the code is changed to use `contentOf(...).contains(...)`, which is a different way of asserting the same kind of content.
   - In branch `b`, the only change is the deletion of a newline character, which is a minor formatting change and does not affect the logic.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a new method (`contentOf`) and replaces `has(contentContaining(...))` with `contains(...)`. This is a meaningful change in the assertion style and may reflect a preference for a more readable or modern assertion style.
   - **Branch `b`** only removes a newline, which is a formatting change and does not affect the logic or correctness of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of **branch `a`** seems to be to refactor the assertion style for clarity or to align with a new testing framework or convention.
   - The intention of **branch `b`** is likely to clean up formatting, possibly to reduce unnecessary whitespace.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in **branch `a`** is more substantial and meaningful, and it aligns with the goal of improving clarity in assertions.
   - The change in **branch `b`** is minor and does not conflict with the logic of `a`.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the logic from `a` and apply the formatting change from `b` (i.e., remove the newline) to keep the code clean.

```java
assertThat(contentOf(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "curl-request.adoc")))
		.contains("'https://api.example.com/'");
assertThat(contentOf(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "http-request.adoc")))
		.contains("api.example.com");
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
assertThat(contentOf(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "curl-request.adoc"))).contains("'https://api.example.com/'");
		assertThat(contentOf(new File(defaultSnippetsDir, "http-request.adoc"))).contains("api.example.com");
