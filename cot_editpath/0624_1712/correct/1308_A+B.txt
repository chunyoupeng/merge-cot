### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public interface ServerVariables extends Constructible, Extensible<ServerVariables> {
||||||| base
public interface ServerVariables extends Constructible, Extensible<ServerVariables>, Map<String, ServerVariable> {
=======
@Deprecated
public interface ServerVariables extends Constructible, Extensible<ServerVariables>, Map<String, ServerVariable> {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> , Map < String , ServerVariable >


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Deprecated <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the interface `Map<String, ServerVariable>` from the `ServerVariables` interface.
   - **Branch `b`** added the `@Deprecated` annotation to the `ServerVariables` interface.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing the `Map<String, ServerVariable>` interface suggests that the `ServerVariables` interface no longer needs to behave like a map. This could be due to a design change where the map functionality is no longer required or has been replaced by another mechanism.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding the `@Deprecated` annotation indicates that the `ServerVariables` interface is no longer recommended for use and may be removed or replaced in the future.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to simplify or refactor the interface by removing unnecessary or outdated dependencies.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to signal that the interface is deprecated, possibly in preparation for its removal or replacement.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@Deprecated` annotation from branch `b` should be retained because it provides important information to users of the interface.
   - The removal of `Map<String, ServerVariable>` from branch `a` should also be retained if the interface no longer needs to implement the map functionality.
   - The final interface should include both changes: it should be deprecated and should no longer extend the `Map<String, ServerVariable>` interface.
