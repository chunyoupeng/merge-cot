### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

if (t9InputViewGroup.isShown()){

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> { <newline> t9InputViewGroup . clearAnimation ( ) ; <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> { <newline> t9InputViewGroup . clearAnimation ( ) ; <newline> <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the condition `if (t9InputViewGroup.isShown())` is followed directly by `t9InputViewGroup.startAnimation(anim);` without any newline or formatting.
   - **Branch a** adds a newline and inserts `t9InputViewGroup.clearAnimation();` between the condition and the `startAnimation` call.
   - **Branch b** also adds `t9InputViewGroup.clearAnimation();`, but it adds **two** newlines, which may suggest a more aggressive formatting change.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both **a** and **b** aim to clear the animation before starting a new one, which is a logical and common pattern in UI animations to avoid overlapping or stale animations.
   - The **difference** lies in the formatting: **a** adds one newline, while **b** adds two. This is a **style** difference, not a functional one.
   - The **functionality** of both changes is the same: clear the animation before starting a new one.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both **a** and **b** is to **improve the animation behavior** by ensuring that any previous animation is cleared before starting a new one.
   - The formatting differences (one vs. two newlines) likely reflect different code style preferences or auto-formatting settings.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the **functional change** is the same in both branches, the **correctness** and **business logic** are aligned.
   - The **code style** difference is minor and can be resolved by choosing a consistent style (e.g., one newline).
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to **keep the functional change** (adding `clearAnimation()`) and **adopt a consistent formatting style** (e.g., one newline).

if (t9InputViewGroup.isShown()){
