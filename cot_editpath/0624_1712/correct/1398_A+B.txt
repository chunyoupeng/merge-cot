### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
*                       SOS phenomenon time
||||||| base
*            SOS phenomenon time
=======
*            SOS phenomenon time
     * @throws OwsExceptionReport
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> * @ throws OwsExceptionReport


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the line is: `*            SOS phenomenon time`
   - In branch `a`, the line is: `*                       SOS phenomenon time`
     - This indicates that branch `a` added 9 spaces before "SOS phenomenon time".
   - In branch `b`, the line is the same as in the base: `*            SOS phenomenon time`
     - No change to the line itself.
   - Additionally, branch `b` added a new line: `* @throws OwsExceptionReport` after the comment line.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** The addition of 9 spaces likely aims to align the comment with some formatting standard or to match indentation in the surrounding code. This is a stylistic change.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The addition of the `@throws` Javadoc tag is a functional change, adding documentation about an exception that might be thrown.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to improve code formatting or alignment, possibly for readability or to follow a specific style guide.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to enhance documentation by adding a Javadoc `@throws` tag, which is important for API clarity and developer understanding.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes: one is stylistic, the other is functional.
   - The `@throws` tag from branch `b` should be preserved as it adds important documentation.
   - The indentation change from branch `a` should also be preserved if it aligns with the project's style guide or improves readability.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both changes: the increased indentation and the added `@throws` line.
