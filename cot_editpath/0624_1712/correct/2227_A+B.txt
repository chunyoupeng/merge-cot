### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
reference.put(GetVehicleDataResponse.KEY_HANDS_OFF_STEERING, VehicleDataHelper.HANDS_OFF_STEERING);
			reference.put(Test.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
||||||| base
reference.put(Test.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
=======
reference.put(TestValues.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> reference . put ( GetVehicleDataResponse . KEY_HANDS_OFF_STEERING , VehicleDataHelper . HANDS_OFF_STEERING ) ; <newline>


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Test <WITH> TestValues)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     reference.put(Test.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
     ```
   - In branch `a`, a new line is added:
     ```java
     reference.put(GetVehicleDataResponse.KEY_HANDS_OFF_STEERING, VehicleDataHelper.HANDS_OFF_STEERING);
     ```
     This adds a new key-value pair to the `reference` map.
   - In branch `b`, the `Test` class is replaced with `TestValues` in the same line:
     ```java
     reference.put(TestValues.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
     ```
     This suggests a change in the source of the constant from `Test` to `TestValues`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding a new key-value pair is a logical extension of the `reference` map. It introduces a new feature or data point (`KEY_HANDS_OFF_STEERING`) that is likely relevant to the application's functionality.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Replacing `Test` with `TestValues` is a refactor or a move of constants from one class to another. This is a common practice to organize constants better or to follow a naming convention.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To enhance the `reference` map with a new key-value pair that represents a specific vehicle data feature (`hands off steering`).
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To refactor the code by moving or renaming the constant `GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME` from the `Test` class to the `TestValues` class, likely for better organization or naming consistency.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The addition in `a` introduces a new feature, while the change in `b` is a refactor.
   - The refactor in `b` should be applied to the existing line from the base, and the new line from `a` should be added as well.
   - The final merged code should include both changes: the new key-value pair from `a` and the updated constant reference from `b`.

```java
reference.put(GetVehicleDataResponse.KEY_HANDS_OFF_STEERING, VehicleDataHelper.HANDS_OFF_STEERING);
reference.put(TestValues.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
reference.put(GetVehicleDataResponse.KEY_HANDS_OFF_STEERING, VehicleDataHelper.HANDS_OFF_STEERING);
			reference.put(TestValues.GENERAL_OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_NAME, VehicleDataHelper.OEM_CUSTOM_VEHICLE_DATA_STATE);
