### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> toWorkspacePage , <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> mCurrentAnimation = fromWorkspaceState , <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed `toWorkspacePage` from the argument list of the `startAnimationToWorkspaceFromOverlay` function call. The order of the remaining arguments is slightly adjusted accordingly.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new variable `mCurrentAnimation` to store the result of the function call and added a new parameter `fromWorkspaceState` to the function call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing `toWorkspacePage` suggests that it is no longer needed as an argument for the animation function. This could indicate a simplification or refactoring of the function's interface.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding `mCurrentAnimation` allows for tracking or referencing the animation later, which is a common pattern in animation logic. Adding `fromWorkspaceState` implies that the animation now depends on the source workspace state, which is a logical enhancement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** Likely to simplify the function call by removing an unnecessary parameter (`toWorkspacePage`), possibly because the function no longer requires it or it is now inferred.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To enhance the animation logic by tracking the animation object and incorporating the source workspace state, which is likely needed for more accurate or complex animations.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The function call should include `fromWorkspaceState` as it provides necessary context for the animation.
   - The variable `mCurrentAnimation` should be added to store the result of the animation, which is a good practice for future reference.
   - The parameter `toWorkspacePage` should be removed as it is no longer needed.
   - The order of the arguments should be adjusted to match the updated function signature.

```java
mCurrentAnimation = startAnimationToWorkspaceFromOverlay(fromWorkspaceState, toWorkspaceState,
                mLauncher.getAllAppsButton(), appsView, appsView.getContentView(),
                appsView.getRevealView(), appsView.getSearchBarView(), animated,
                onCompleteRunnable, cb);
