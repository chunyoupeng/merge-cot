### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> cubes <WITH> play)
<ADD> - circle


## From base to b
<ADD> if ( isSshEnabled ( ) ) { <newline> tabs . add ( new UserTab ( " Ssh Keys " , " fa fa - fw fa - shield " , UserSshKeysPage . class ) ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `a`, the icon for the "Build Setting" tab is changed from `fa-cubes` to `fa-play-circle`, and the tab name is slightly modified to "Build Setting" (no change in name, but the icon change is significant).
   - In `b`, a new tab "Ssh Keys" is added conditionally using `isSshEnabled()`, and the original "Build Setting" tab is retained with the original `fa-cubes` icon.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** The icon change from `fa-cubes` to `fa-play-circle` likely reflects a change in the semantic meaning of the tab. `fa-play-circle` might indicate a "start" or "execution" context, which could be appropriate if the tab is now used to initiate builds or settings related to execution.
   - **Change in `b`:** The addition of the "Ssh Keys" tab is a new feature that is conditionally enabled. This is a non-conflicting addition and should be preserved. The original "Build Setting" tab is kept with the original icon, which suggests that the intention was not to change the icon but to add a new tab.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention in `a`:** The intention is to visually distinguish the "Build Setting" tab by changing its icon to something that better represents its new purpose (e.g., execution or starting a build).
   - **Intention in `b`:** The intention is to add a new tab for SSH keys, which is a separate feature that should be conditionally displayed based on whether SSH is enabled.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The addition of the "Ssh Keys" tab in `b` is a new feature and should be preserved.
   - The icon change in `a` for the "Build Setting" tab should also be preserved, as it reflects a change in the tab's purpose.
   - The resolution should include both changes: the new tab from `b` and the icon change from `a`.

    tabs.add(new UserTab("Ssh Keys", "fa fa-fw fa-shield", UserSshKeysPage.class));
