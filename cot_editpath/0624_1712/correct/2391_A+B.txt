### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
<T1> T1 getProperty(Property property, T1 defaultValue);
||||||| base
<T> T getProperty(Property property, T defaultValue);
=======
<T> T getProperty(int property, T defaultValue);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> T <WITH> T1)
<REPLACE> T <WITH> T1)
<REPLACE> T <WITH> T1)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Property <WITH> int)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the **base** version, the method signature is:
     ```java
     <T> T getProperty(Property property, T defaultValue);
     ```
   - In **branch a**, the method signature is:
     ```java
     <T1> T1 getProperty(Property property, T1 defaultValue);
     ```
     This change replaces all instances of the generic type `T` with `T1`. The parameter `Property property` remains unchanged.
   - In **branch b**, the method signature is:
     ```java
     <T> T getProperty(int property, T defaultValue);
     ```
     This change replaces the parameter type `Property property` with `int property`. The generic type `T` remains unchanged.

   The conflict arises because both branches have modified the same method signature in different ways:
   - **Branch a** changes the generic type from `T` to `T1`.
   - **Branch b** changes the parameter type from `Property` to `int`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change (`T` → `T1`)**:
     - This is a renaming of the generic type parameter. It does not change the behavior of the method, only the name used in the signature.
     - This could be for clarity, consistency with other code, or to avoid naming conflicts.
     - It is a **non-functional change** and should be evaluated based on naming conventions and readability.
   - **Branch b's change (`Property` → `int`)**:
     - This is a **functional change** that alters the method's behavior.
     - It changes the method to accept an `int` instead of a `Property` object. This could indicate a refactoring where `Property` is being replaced with a simpler or more efficient representation.
     - This change is more significant and likely reflects a deeper architectural or design decision.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention**:
     - The intention is likely to rename the generic type parameter for clarity or consistency with other parts of the codebase.
     - This is a **cosmetic or stylistic change**.
   - **Branch b's intention**:
     - The intention is to **refactor the method to use a primitive `int` instead of a `Property` object**, which could be for performance, simplification, or to align with a new design.
     - This is a **functional or architectural change**.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since **branch b's change is functional and more significant**, it should be prioritized.
   - **Branch a's change is a renaming of the generic type**, which is a **stylistic change** and can be applied on top of the functional change.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to **apply the change from branch b first**, and then apply the renaming from branch a on top of it.
   - The final method signature should be:
     ```java
     <T1> T1 getProperty(int property, T1 defaultValue);
     ```
     This preserves the **functional change** from branch b and incorporates the **stylistic change** from branch a.

```java
<T1> T1 getProperty(int property, T1 defaultValue);
```
