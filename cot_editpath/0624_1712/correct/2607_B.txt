### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> private boolean ejectionScheduled ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the declaration of class-level variables.
   - **Branch `a`** has not made any changes to the variable declarations compared to the base.
   - **Branch `b`** has added a new variable: `private boolean ejectionScheduled;`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** has kept the code as it was in the base. There are no new variables or changes to the existing ones.
   - **Branch `b`** has introduced a new boolean variable `ejectionScheduled`, which likely indicates whether an ejection action is scheduled to occur. This is a meaningful addition that introduces new functionality or state tracking.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** appears to be focused on maintaining the current structure and possibly making formatting or whitespace adjustments (e.g., spacing in variable declarations).
   - **Branch `b`** is introducing a new feature or behavior by adding the `ejectionScheduled` flag.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` has not made any functional changes and `b` has added a new variable that introduces new functionality, the correct resolution is to keep all the variable declarations from `a` and include the new variable from `b`.
   - The formatting of the variable declarations in `a` is consistent and clean, so we will adopt that style for the final merged code.

# Final Resolution

```java
private TileEntityCache[] tileCache;
    public static final int BUFFER_EMPTY_INTERVAL = 10;
    protected byte animationTicker = -1;
    protected static final int ANIMATION_TIME = 7;
    private boolean isAnimating;
    private boolean ejectionScheduled;
```
