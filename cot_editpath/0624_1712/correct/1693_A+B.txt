### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> String <WITH> URI)
<REPLACE> FontResolver <WITH> InternalResourceResolver)
<REPLACE> resolver <WITH> resourceResolver)
<DELETE> <newline> fontFileURI = fontFileURI . trim ( ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> EmbeddingMode embeddingMode , <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Changed the parameter type of `fontFileURI` from `String` to `URI`.
     - Replaced `FontResolver` with `InternalResourceResolver`.
     - Removed the line `fontFileURI = fontFileURI.trim();`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Added a new parameter `EmbeddingMode embeddingMode`.
     - No other changes to the method signature.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Changing `String` to `URI` is a significant change that implies stricter type safety and potentially more robust handling of font file URIs.
     - Replacing `FontResolver` with `InternalResourceResolver` suggests a more specific resolver is needed for internal resources.
     - Removing the `trim()` call might be intentional if the `URI` type already handles whitespace or if it's unnecessary for the new logic.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Adding `EmbeddingMode` is a logical extension to the method, allowing more control over how the font is embedded.
     - No other changes to the method body suggest the `trim()` is still needed for the `String` version.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** seems to be modernizing the method to use more specific types (`URI`, `InternalResourceResolver`) and removing unnecessary operations (`trim()`).
   - **Branch b** is extending the method's functionality by adding a new parameter for embedding mode, which is a natural evolution of the API.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `URI` type is more robust and should be kept.
   - `InternalResourceResolver` is a more specific resolver and should be kept.
   - The `trim()` operation is unnecessary if the `URI` type is used and should be removed.
   - The new `EmbeddingMode` parameter is a logical addition and should be included.
   - The `FontResolver` parameter is replaced by `InternalResourceResolver`, so it should not be kept.
   - The `EncodingMode` parameter is kept as it is relevant to the font encoding.

# Final Resolution

```java
public static CustomFont loadFont(URI fontFileURI, String subFontName,
        boolean embedded, EmbeddingMode embeddingMode, EncodingMode encodingMode,
        boolean useKerning, boolean useAdvanced, InternalResourceResolver resourceResolver) throws IOException {
```
