### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** added a detailed Javadoc comment to the `expandBeam` method. This comment explains the purpose of the method and documents its parameters and return value.
   - **Branch b** replaced the generic type `Hypothesis<TK, FV>` with `Derivation<TK, FV>` in the method signature. This is a type change that likely reflects a design or refactoring decision.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The **Javadoc comment** from `a` is valuable for documentation and understanding the method's purpose. It should be preserved to maintain clarity for future developers.
   - The **type change** from `Hypothesis` to `Derivation` in `b` is a structural change that likely reflects a broader architectural or naming decision. This change should be preserved if it aligns with the project's design goals.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to improve documentation and clarity by adding a Javadoc comment.
   - The intention of `b` is to refactor the code to use a different type (`Derivation`), which may indicate a shift in terminology or a more accurate modeling of the data structure.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The Javadoc comment from `a` should be preserved and applied to the updated method signature from `b`.
   - The method signature from `b` should be used as it reflects the updated type usage.
   - The resolution should combine both changes: the updated method signature with the detailed Javadoc comment.
