### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
void removePost(int postPosition);
||||||| base

=======
Observable<Post> getVisibleItems();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, meaning both branches `a` and `b` have independently added new content.
   - Branch `a` added the method declaration: `void removePost(int postPosition);`
   - Branch `b` added the method declaration: `Observable<Post> getVisibleItems();`
   - These two method declarations are in conflict because they are both at the same position in the file (the top of the file, since the base is empty).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both methods appear to be valid and serve different purposes:
     - `removePost(int postPosition)` is likely for deleting a post at a specific index.
     - `getVisibleItems()` is likely for retrieving a stream or list of visible posts.
   - Neither method is redundant or incorrect in isolation.
   - Since both are new additions and do not overlap in functionality, there is no reason to discard either.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a way to remove a post at a specific position.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide a way to retrieve visible posts, likely for UI or filtering purposes.
   - These intentions are orthogonal and complementary.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both methods are valid and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to include both methods in the final code.
   - The order of the methods may not matter, but it is good practice to keep them in the order they were added or to organize them logically.

void removePost(int postPosition);
Observable<Post> getVisibleItems();
```
