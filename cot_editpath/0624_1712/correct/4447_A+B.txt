### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> executerType <WITH> executorType)


## From base to b
<ADD> long maxCpuInUsByCreator = trx . getRawData ( ) . getMaxCpuUsage ( ) ; <newline> long limitInDrop = trx . getRawData ( ) . getFeeLimit ( ) ; <newline>
<REPLACE> contract <WITH> limitInDrop)
<ADD> , <newline> maxCpuInUsByCreator


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Changed `executerType` to `executorType` (a typo fix).
     - Kept the original logic of computing `accountCPULimitInUs` using `getAccountCPULimitInUs(creator, contract)`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduced new variables: `maxCpuInUsByCreator` and `limitInDrop`.
     - Modified the method call to `getAccountCPULimitInUs(creator, limitInDrop, maxCpuInUsByCreator)`, adding two new parameters.
     - Also corrected `executerType` to `executorType`.

   The conflict is centered around the variable name `executerType` and the method call to `getAccountCPULimitInUs`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The correction of `executerType` to `executorType` is a valid fix for a typo.
     - The method call remains unchanged, which implies the original logic is still valid.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The correction of `executerType` to `executorType` is also valid.
     - The new variables and the updated method call suggest that `b` is introducing a more refined logic for computing the CPU limit, taking into account additional parameters like `limitInDrop` and `maxCpuInUsByCreator`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Intends to fix a typo in the variable name and preserve the original logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Intends to enhance the logic for computing the CPU limit by incorporating new parameters and variables.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The typo fix from `executerType` to `executorType` is essential and should be retained.
   - The logic from `b` is more comprehensive and introduces additional parameters for computing the CPU limit, which likely reflects a more accurate or updated business requirement.
   - Therefore, the method call from `b` should be used, and the typo fix from `a` should be applied to it.

```java
long maxCpuInUsByCreator = trx.getRawData().getMaxCpuUsage();
      long limitInDrop = trx.getRawData().getFeeLimit();
      long accountCPULimitInUs = getAccountCPULimitInUs(creator, limitInDrop,
          maxCpuInUsByCreator);
      if (executorType == ET_NORMAL_TYPE) {
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
long maxCpuInUsByCreator = trx.getRawData().getMaxCpuUsage();
      long limitInDrop = trx.getRawData().getFeeLimit();
      long accountCPULimitInUs = getAccountCPULimitInUs(creator, limitInDrop,
          maxCpuInUsByCreator);
      if (executorType == ET_NORMAL_TYPE) {
