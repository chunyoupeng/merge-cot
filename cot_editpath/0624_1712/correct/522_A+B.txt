### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

case CLASS:
        token = jj_consume_token(CLASS);
        break;
      case CLASSES:
        token = jj_consume_token(CLASSES);
        break;
      case MINDEPTH:
        token = jj_consume_token(MINDEPTH);

case NEAR:

      case WITHIN:

        break;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a `switch` block where both branches `a` and `b` have added new `case` statements.
   - **Branch `a`** added:
     ```java
     case CLASS:
         token = jj_consume_token(CLASS);
         break;
     case CLASSES:
         token = jj_consume_token(CLASSES);
         break;
     case MINDEPTH:
         token = jj_consume_token(MINDEPTH);
         break;
     ```
   - **Branch `b`** added:
     ```java
     case NEAR:
         token = jj_consume_token(NEAR);
         break;
     case WITHIN:
         token = jj_consume_token(WITHIN);
         break;
     ```
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own `case` statements.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of `case` statements are syntactically valid and follow the same pattern.
   - The `jj_consume_token(...)` pattern is consistent across both branches.
   - There is no overlap in the token types (`CLASS`, `CLASSES`, `MINDEPTH` vs. `NEAR`, `WITHIN`), so the changes are additive and do not conflict in terms of logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - It appears that both branches are extending the `switch` block to handle additional token types.
   - The intention is to support more query or parsing capabilities by recognizing new keywords (`CLASS`, `CLASSES`, `MINDEPTH`, `NEAR`, `WITHIN`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of `case` statements are non-conflicting and additive, the correct resolution is to **combine both sets** into the final code.
   - The order of the `case` statements may not be critical, but it's good practice to preserve the order from both branches if possible or sort them alphabetically for clarity.
   - No changes are needed to the logic or structure of the code.
