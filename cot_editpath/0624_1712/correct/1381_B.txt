### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if(welcomeMessage != null) {
||||||| base
if(welcomeMessage != null) {
=======
if (welcomeMessage != null) {
<<<<<<< b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the line `if(welcomeMessage != null) {`.
   - In `base`, the line is written as: `if(welcomeMessage != null) {`.
   - In `a`, the line is written as: `if(welcomeMessage != null) {` — no change from base.
   - In `b`, the line is written as: `if (welcomeMessage != null) {` — the only difference is the addition of a space between `if` and `(`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` made no changes to the line compared to `base`.
   - `b` added a space after `if`, which is a code style change. This is a common formatting preference in Java (e.g., `if (condition)` is more common than `if(condition)`).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` likely did not intend to change the line and kept it as-is.
   - `b` likely intended to improve code readability by aligning with a common Java style guide.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` made no changes, the only meaningful change is from `b`.
   - The change from `b` is a minor but valid code style improvement.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the version from `b` to maintain consistent and readable code.
