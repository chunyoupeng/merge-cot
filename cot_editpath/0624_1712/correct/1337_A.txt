### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
                    logger.debug("Append journal entry, {}", voterInfo());
                }
||||||| base
logger.debug("Append journal entry, {}", voterInfo());
=======
if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
                    logger.debug("Append journal entry, {}", voterInfo());
                }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> if ( logger . isDebugEnabled ( ) ) { <newline> <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> if ( logger . isDebugEnabled ( ) ) { <newline> <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code has a direct call to `logger.debug(...)`.
   - Both `a` and `b` added an `if (logger.isDebugEnabled())` block around the same `logger.debug(...)` line.
   - The conflict is that both `a` and `b` independently added the same conditional check, and now Git is unable to merge them cleanly.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are adding the same conditional check to prevent unnecessary logging when debug is disabled.
   - This is a common optimization pattern in logging to avoid string construction overhead when logging is disabled.
   - Since both changes are identical in effect, there is no functional difference between the two branches.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both `a` and `b` is to optimize performance by only calling `logger.debug(...)` when debug logging is enabled.
   - This is a best practice in logging frameworks like SLF4J or Log4j.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` added the same conditional logic, the correct resolution is to keep the conditional check once.
   - We can choose either `a` or `b`'s version, as they are functionally identical.
   - The resolution should preserve the conditional logging pattern and ensure clean formatting.
