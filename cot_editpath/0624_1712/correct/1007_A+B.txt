### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public static final String MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE = "mache";

	public static final String BIGQUERY_JOB_ID_PARAM = "jobId";

	public static final String RETRY_COUNT_PARAM = "retryCount";
||||||| base
public static final String MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE = "mache";
=======
public static final String MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE = "mache";

	public static final String MINUTES_HISTORY_PARAM = "minutesHistory";
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> <newline> public static final String BIGQUERY_JOB_ID_PARAM = " jobId " ; <newline> <newline> public static final String RETRY_COUNT_PARAM = " retryCount " ;


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> public static final String MINUTES_HISTORY_PARAM = " minutesHistory " ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `a`, two new constants were added: `BIGQUERY_JOB_ID_PARAM` and `RETRY_COUNT_PARAM`.
   - In `b`, one new constant was added: `MINUTES_HISTORY_PARAM`.
   - All three constants are of the same type (`public static final String`) and are added in the same general location in the code (after `MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE`).
   - The conflict arises because both branches added new constants in the same place, and Git cannot automatically determine which one to keep or how to merge them.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `BIGQUERY_JOB_ID_PARAM` and `RETRY_COUNT_PARAM` likely relate to job tracking and retry logic in a system that uses BigQuery.
   - `MINUTES_HISTORY_PARAM` likely relates to a time-based parameter for historical data retrieval.
   - All three constants appear to be valid and likely serve different purposes in the application. There is no indication that any of them are redundant or conflicting in functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` seems to be to add parameters for tracking BigQuery jobs and retries.
   - The intention in `b` seems to be to add a parameter for specifying how much historical data to retrieve.
   - These intentions are distinct and do not overlap in functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since all three constants are valid and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to include all of them in the final code.
   - The only issue is the formatting: in `a` and `b`, the added constants have extra newlines and spaces that should be cleaned up for consistency.
   - The final code should include all three constants with consistent formatting.

```java
public static final String MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE = "mache";

public static final String BIGQUERY_JOB_ID_PARAM = "jobId";

public static final String RETRY_COUNT_PARAM = "retryCount";

public static final String MINUTES_HISTORY_PARAM = "minutesHistory";
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public static final String MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE = "mache";

	public static final String BIGQUERY_JOB_ID_PARAM = "jobId";

	public static final String RETRY_COUNT_PARAM = "retryCount";	
	public static final String MINUTES_HISTORY_PARAM = "minutesHistory";
