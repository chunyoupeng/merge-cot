### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

if (scheduleExpiration && session != null && (session.isHandshook() || session.isConnected()))
                    session.scheduleExpiration(getInterval());
||||||| base
if (startInterval && session != null && session.isConnected())
                    session.startIntervalTimeout(getInterval());

if (startInterval && session != null && session.isConnected()) {
                    session.startIntervalTimeout(getInterval());
                }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> startInterval <WITH> scheduleExpiration)
<ADD> ( session . isHandshook ( ) | | )
<REPLACE> startIntervalTimeout <WITH> scheduleExpiration)


## From base to b
<ADD> { <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `startInterval` with `scheduleExpiration`.
     - Added the condition `session.isHandshook()` to the `if` statement.
     - Replaced `startIntervalTimeout` with `scheduleExpiration`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a `{}` block to the `if` statement, which is a code formatting change.
   - The conflict occurs in the `if` condition and the method call inside it.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The replacement of `startInterval` with `scheduleExpiration` and the method call `scheduleExpiration(getInterval())` suggests a new behavior is being introduced.
     - The addition of `session.isHandshook()` broadens the condition under which the code runs, allowing it to trigger even if the session is not connected but is handshook.
     - This change likely reflects a new requirement or logic to handle sessions that are in a handshake state.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `{}` is a code style improvement. It doesn't change the logic but makes the block more readable and less error-prone in the future.
     - This change is safe and should be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely introducing a new behavior where the session expiration is scheduled not only when the session is connected but also when it is handshook.
   - **Branch `b`** is improving code readability by adding braces to the `if` block.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The logic from `a` should be preserved because it introduces a new condition and behavior.
   - The formatting change from `b` should also be preserved to maintain readability.
   - The final code should include both the updated condition and the added braces.

    session.scheduleExpiration(getInterval());
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
if (scheduleExpiration && session != null && (session.isHandshook() || session.isConnected())) {
                    session.scheduleExpiration(getInterval());
                }
