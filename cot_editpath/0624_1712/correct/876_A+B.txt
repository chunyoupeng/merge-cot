### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@NotNull
    public Context getContext() {
||||||| base
@NonNull
    public Context getContext() {
=======
@NonNull
    protected C getContext() {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> NonNull <WITH> NotNull)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> public <WITH> protected)
<REPLACE> Context <WITH> C)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method is `@NonNull public Context getContext()`.
   - In branch `a`, the method is changed to `@NotNull public Context getContext()`. This is a change in the annotation from `@NonNull` to `@NotNull`.
   - In branch `b`, the method is changed to `@NonNull protected C getContext()`. This is a change in both the access modifier from `public` to `protected` and the return type from `Context` to `C`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change (`@NonNull` → `@NotNull`)**:
     - This is likely a renaming of the annotation (e.g., due to a library or framework change). If `@NotNull` is functionally equivalent to `@NonNull`, this change is acceptable and reflects a style or naming convention update.
   - **Branch `b` change (`public` → `protected`, `Context` → `C`)**:
     - The access modifier change suggests a desire to restrict access to the method, possibly for encapsulation or refactoring.
     - The return type change from `Context` to `C` implies a type abstraction or generalization. This could be part of a broader design change or refactoring.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to update the annotation to a new naming convention or library standard.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to encapsulate the method and generalize the return type for flexibility or abstraction.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The annotation change in `a` can be incorporated if `@NotNull` is the preferred naming convention.
   - The access modifier and return type changes in `b` reflect a more structural change and should be preserved if the design intent is to encapsulate and generalize.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to combine the annotation from `a` with the access modifier and return type from `b`.
