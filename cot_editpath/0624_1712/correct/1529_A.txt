### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> HighLevelStateChangePacket <WITH> EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage)
<REPLACE> HighLevelStatePacket <WITH> HighLevelStateChangeMessage)
<ADD> humanoidRobotics .
<REPLACE> InvalidPacketNotificationPacket <WITH> HighLevelStateMessage)


## From base to b
<ADD> import us . ihmc . humanoidRobotics . communication . packets . EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage ; <newline>
<DELETE> <newline> import us . ihmc . communication . packets . InvalidPacketNotificationPacket ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `HighLevelStateChangePacket` with `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage`.
     - Replaced `HighLevelStatePacket` with `HighLevelStateChangeMessage`.
     - Added `humanoidRobotics` to the import path (likely a typo or formatting fix).
     - Replaced `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` with `HighLevelStateMessage`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Added `import us.ihmc.humanoidRobotics.communication.packets.EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage;`.
     - Removed `import us.ihmc.communication.packets.InvalidPacketNotificationPacket;`.

   The conflict is in the import statements. Both branches are trying to replace or remove the `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` and add `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - Replacing `HighLevelStateChangePacket` with `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage` suggests a shift in the type of message being used.
     - Replacing `HighLevelStatePacket` with `HighLevelStateChangeMessage` indicates a reorganization of message types.
     - Replacing `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` with `HighLevelStateMessage` could be an attempt to simplify or unify message types.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Adding `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage` is likely for the same reason as in `a`.
     - Removing `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` suggests it is no longer needed.

   Both branches are moving toward using `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage` and removing `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket`.

3. **Understand the intention:**
   - The intention appears to be to modernize or refactor the message types used in the codebase.
   - `a` is aggressively replacing multiple message types, possibly to unify or simplify the message system.
   - `b` is more conservative, only adding the new message and removing the obsolete one.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most logical resolution is to keep the imports from `a` since they reflect a more comprehensive update.
   - However, `b`'s addition of `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage` is consistent with `a`'s changes.
   - The removal of `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` in `b` is also consistent with `a`'s replacement of it with `HighLevelStateMessage`.
   - Therefore, the final import list should include the updated message types from `a` and exclude the obsolete one from `b`.
