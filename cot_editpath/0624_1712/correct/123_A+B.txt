### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** changed `ProcessResult` to `ResultCode` and kept the original error message string.
   - **Branch b** replaced the hardcoded error message with localized messages using `NbBundle.getMessage(...)`. It also changed the class name and method names to be more specific and removed the hardcoded error message.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change** to `ResultCode` is likely a refactor to use a different enum or class for result codes. This is a structural change and doesn't affect the message content.
   - **Branch b's change** is more substantial. It introduces internationalization/localization by using `NbBundle.getMessage(...)`, which is a common practice in Java applications for supporting multiple languages. This is a significant improvement in terms of maintainability and user experience.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention** was likely to refactor the return type for consistency or to use a different API.
   - **Branch b's intention** was to improve the code by making it more maintainable and user-friendly through localization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The use of `NbBundle.getMessage(...)` from **branch b** is a better long-term solution for error messages.
   - The change from `ProcessResult` to `ResultCode` from **branch a** is a refactor that should be preserved.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should combine both changes: use the localized messages from **branch b** and the updated return type from **branch a**.
