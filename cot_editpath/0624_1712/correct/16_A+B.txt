### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import stroom.security.shared.User;
import stroom.svg.client.SvgPresets;
||||||| base
import stroom.security.shared.User;
import stroom.widget.button.client.GlyphIcons;
=======
import stroom.security.shared.FindUserCriteria;
import stroom.widget.button.client.GlyphIcons;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> widget <WITH> svg)
<DELETE> . button
<REPLACE> GlyphIcons <WITH> SvgPresets)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> User <WITH> FindUserCriteria)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the following imports are present:
     ```java
     import stroom.security.shared.User;
     import stroom.widget.button.client.GlyphIcons;
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the following changes are made:
     - Replaced `GlyphIcons` with `SvgPresets`.
     - Removed `.button` from `widget.button`.
     - Replaced `widget` with `svg`.
   - In branch `b`, the following changes are made:
     - Replaced `User` with `FindUserCriteria`.

   The conflict arises because both branches have modified the same lines of the base code in different ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replacing `GlyphIcons` with `SvgPresets` suggests a move from using GlyphIcons to SVG presets, likely for a more modern or scalable icon system.
     - Removing `.button` and replacing `widget` with `svg` implies a refactoring of the UI component structure, possibly to use SVG-based widgets instead of button-based ones.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Replacing `User` with `FindUserCriteria` suggests a shift in the data model or API usage, from directly referencing a `User` object to using a criteria object for searching users.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** The intention is to modernize the UI by replacing GlyphIcons with SVG presets and refactoring the widget structure to use SVG-based components.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** The intention is to update the data model or API usage to use `FindUserCriteria` instead of `User`, likely to support more flexible querying of user data.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in both branches are orthogonal: one is a UI-related refactor, and the other is a data model/API refactor.
   - Therefore, both changes can be merged without conflict.
   - The final import list should include both `FindUserCriteria` and `SvgPresets`, as they represent distinct and non-conflicting updates.
