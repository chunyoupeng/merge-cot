### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Toast msg = Toast.makeText(this,
                ErrorMessageAdapter.getErrorCauseMessage(result, operation, getResources()),
                Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
||||||| base
Toast msg = Toast.makeText(this, ErrorMessageAdapter.getErrorCauseMessage(result, operation, getResources()), 
                Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
=======
Toast msg = Toast.makeText(this, ErrorMessageAdapter.getErrorCauseMessage(result, operation, getResources()),
                Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline>



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the line where the `Toast` message is created.
   - From the base to `a`: An additional newline character is inserted after the opening parenthesis of the `Toast.makeText` method. This is a formatting change.
   - From the base to `b`: No changes are made compared to the base. The code remains the same.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` is purely a formatting adjustment (adding a newline). It doesn't affect the logic or functionality of the code.
   - The change in `b` is the absence of any modification, meaning it preserves the original formatting from the base.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` seems to be to improve code readability by adding a newline after the method call's opening parenthesis. This is a common style preference in some codebases.
   - The intention of `b` is to maintain the original formatting and not introduce any stylistic changes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the only difference is a newline added in `a`, and `b` has no changes, the resolution should preserve the logic and formatting of `b` while optionally adopting the formatting from `a` if the team prefers it.
   - However, since `b` is unchanged and `a` only introduces a stylistic change, the most neutral and safe resolution is to keep the original formatting from `b` unless there is a strong reason to adopt the formatting from `a`.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the code as it is in `b`.
