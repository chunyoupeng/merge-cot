### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (promise != null) {
                            promise.reject("Failed exchange token", getErrorMessage(ex));
                        }
||||||| base
promise.reject("Failed exchange token", getErrorMessage(ex));
=======
promise.reject("token_exchange_failed", getErrorMessage(ex));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> if ( promise ! = null ) { <newline> <newline> }


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Failed <WITH> token_exchange_failed)
<DELETE> exchange token


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the **base**, the code is: `promise.reject("Failed exchange token", getErrorMessage(ex));`
   - In **branch a**, the code is wrapped in an `if (promise != null)` block. The logic is the same, but it now checks if `promise` is not null before calling `reject`.
   - In **branch b**, the error message is changed from `"Failed exchange token"` to `"token_exchange_failed"`, and the phrase `"exchange token"` is removed.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change** introduces a null check for `promise`. This is a defensive programming practice to avoid a potential `NullPointerException` if `promise` is null. It is a safe and reasonable addition.
   - **Branch b's change** modifies the error message string. This could be for consistency with a new naming convention or to align with a centralized error message system (e.g., using a key like `"token_exchange_failed"` instead of a full message).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** aims to make the code more robust by preventing runtime exceptions.
   - **Branch b** aims to standardize or internationalize error messages, possibly for logging, translation, or centralized error handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The null check from **a** improves code safety, while the error message change from **b** improves consistency.
   - The best resolution is to **combine both changes**: wrap the `reject` call in the null check from **a**, and use the updated error message from **b**.
   - This ensures the code is both safe and consistent with the new message format.

if (promise != null) {
    promise.reject("token_exchange_failed", getErrorMessage(ex));

### Gold (Ground Truth)
if (promise != null) {
                            promise.reject("token_exchange_failed", getErrorMessage(ex));
                        }
