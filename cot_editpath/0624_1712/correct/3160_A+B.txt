### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@Override
    public SnapshotFormat getFormat() {
        return SnapshotFormat.CSV;
    }
||||||| base

=======
@Override
    public String toString() {
        return m_file.toString();
    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two new methods added in branches `a` and `b`.
   - Branch `a` introduces a method `getFormat()` that returns `SnapshotFormat.CSV`.
   - Branch `b` introduces a method `toString()` that returns `m_file.toString()`.
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding entirely new content.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The method `getFormat()` in branch `a` is likely part of a system that supports different snapshot formats, and CSV is one of them. This is a functional addition.
   - The method `toString()` in branch `b` is a standard method for string representation of an object, which is also a valid and common addition.
   - Both changes are independent and do not interfere with each other in terms of code structure or logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to define the snapshot format as CSV.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide a string representation of the object, likely for debugging or logging purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both methods are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to include both methods in the final code.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in the code structure or logic.
   - The resolution should preserve both methods without modification.

```java
@Override
public SnapshotFormat getFormat() {
    return SnapshotFormat.CSV;
}

@Override
public String toString() {
    return m_file.toString();
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
@Override
    public SnapshotFormat getFormat() {
        return SnapshotFormat.CSV;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return m_file.toString();
    }
