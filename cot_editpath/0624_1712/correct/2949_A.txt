### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the Javadoc comment of a method.
   - In the `base` version, the Javadoc uses `*` to denote each line and has inconsistent indentation (some lines are indented with 3 spaces, others with 4).
   - In `a`'s version, the Javadoc is modified to use consistent indentation (all lines start with 7 spaces, indicated by `*`).
   - In `b`'s version, the Javadoc is also modified to use consistent indentation (all lines start with 3 spaces, indicated by `*`).
   - The content of the Javadoc is the same in all versions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` aim to improve the formatting of the Javadoc by aligning the indentation.
   - `a` uses 7 spaces for indentation, which may be inconsistent with the rest of the codebase if it uses a standard like 4 spaces.
   - `b` uses 3 spaces for indentation, which is more likely to align with standard Java code formatting (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ defaults).
   - Neither change affects the functionality of the code, only the formatting of the Javadoc.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` is to improve the readability and consistency of the Javadoc.
   - The difference lies in the indentation style they chose, which may reflect different code style preferences or tools used.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the content is the same and the only difference is formatting, the best resolution is to choose the version that aligns with the project's code style.
   - If the project uses 3 or 4 spaces for indentation, `b`'s version is more appropriate.
   - If the project uses 7 spaces, `a`'s version is appropriate.
   - In the absence of specific style guidelines, `b`'s version is more likely to be consistent with standard Java formatting.
