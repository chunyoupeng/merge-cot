### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

return new ToStringBuilder(this, ToStringStyle.MULTI_LINE_STYLE).append("debug", isDebug()).append("gzipEnabled",

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> new
<ADD> . reflectionToString
<DELETE> append ( " debug " , isDebug ( ) ) . append ( " gzipEnabled " , <newline> isGzipEnabled ( ) ) . append ( " cacheUpdatePeriod " , getCacheUpdatePeriod ( ) ) . append ( " modelUpdatePeriod " , <newline> getModelUpdatePeriod ( ) ) . append ( " disableCache " , isDisableCache ( ) ) .


## From base to b
<DELETE> append ( " debug " , isDebug ( ) ) . append ( " gzipEnabled " , <newline> isGzipEnabled ( ) ) . append ( " cacheUpdatePeriod " , getCacheUpdatePeriod ( ) ) . append ( " modelUpdatePeriod " , <newline> getModelUpdatePeriod ( ) ) . append ( " disableCache " , isDisableCache ( ) ) .


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `new ToStringBuilder(...)` with `ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...)`.
     - Removed all `.append(...)` calls.
     - Used a static method `reflectionToString` which automatically includes all fields.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Removed all `.append(...)` calls.
     - Left the rest of the `ToStringBuilder` usage unchanged.
     - Still uses `new ToStringBuilder(...)`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The use of `ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...)` is a more concise and maintainable way to generate a `toString()` representation.
     - It automatically includes all fields, which is likely the intention of the code.
     - This change reduces boilerplate and is more robust to future field additions.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The removal of `.append(...)` calls is similar to `a`, but it doesn't replace the constructor with the static method.
     - This results in a `ToStringBuilder` that does nothing, which is not useful and may be misleading.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to simplify the `toString()` method by using a more efficient and less error-prone approach.
     - The use of reflection ensures that all fields are included without manual appending.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention appears to be to remove unnecessary `.append(...)` calls, but it fails to provide a meaningful alternative.
     - The result is a `toString()` method that does not include any fields, which is not useful.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The correct resolution is to adopt the approach from **branch `a`**.
   - Using `ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...)` is the most appropriate solution because it is concise, maintainable, and includes all fields.
   - The approach in branch `b` results in a `toString()` method that does not provide any useful information.
   - Therefore, the final code should use `ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...)` as in branch `a`.
