### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> < String , InputStream > < String , String >


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the `attachments` and `headers` fields are initialized with `new HashMap()`, which uses raw types.
   - In branch `a`, the code is completely removed, but the conflict only shows the `a` side as having the same content as the base. This suggests that there may be a formatting or parsing issue in the provided edit sequence, but for the purpose of this analysis, we assume that `a` did not change the `attachments` and `headers` lines.
   - In branch `b`, the `attachments` and `headers` fields are explicitly typed with generic parameters: `HashMap<String, InputStream>()` and `HashMap<String, String>()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` appears to have made no changes to the `attachments` and `headers` lines compared to the base. This implies that the raw type usage remains unchanged.
   - Branch `b` introduces explicit generic type parameters, which is a best practice in Java for type safety and clarity. This change improves code quality and reduces the risk of runtime errors due to incorrect casting.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` seems to be to leave the code as is, maintaining the raw type usage.
   - The intention of `b` is to modernize the code by adding type parameters, which is a common and recommended practice in Java development.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `b` introduces a safer and more maintainable version of the code, and branch `a` does not make any changes to the relevant lines, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from branch `b`. This ensures type safety and aligns with modern Java best practices.
