### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public User(String id, String email, String name, String link, boolean tosAccepted, boolean isAdmin, int type) {
||||||| base
public User(String id, String email, boolean tosAccepted, boolean isAdmin) {
=======
public User(String id, String email, boolean tosAccepted, boolean isAdmin, String sessionId) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> String name , String link , , int type


## From base to b
<ADD> , String sessionId


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base constructor is: `public User(String id, String email, boolean tosAccepted, boolean isAdmin)`
   - Branch `a` added: `String name, String link, int type` (and added commas accordingly).
   - Branch `b` added: `String sessionId`.
   - The conflict arises because both branches added new parameters to the constructor, but in different positions and with different types.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** added `name`, `link`, and `type`. These are likely for user profile information and categorization.
   - **Branch `b`** added `sessionId`, which is likely for tracking session information.
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The order of parameters is important for API consistency and backward compatibility.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be enhancing the user object with more metadata (name, link, type).
   - **Branch `b`** seems to be adding session tracking functionality.
   - The intention is to expand the `User` class with additional relevant data.

4. **Final decision:**
   - To resolve the conflict, we should merge both sets of changes.
   - The order of parameters should be preserved as in `a`, with `sessionId` added at the end to avoid disrupting the order of the other new parameters.
   - This maintains clarity and ensures that the constructor remains usable and consistent.
