### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, getString(R.string.hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast), 1000);
||||||| base
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, Strings.get(Strings.PAINT_INDICATOR_TOAST_ID), 1000);
=======
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, Strings.get(Strings.PAINT_INDICATOR_TOAST_ID), Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> Strings <WITH> getString)
<ADD> ( R
<REPLACE> get <WITH> string)
<DELETE> ( Strings
<REPLACE> PAINT_INDICATOR_TOAST_ID <WITH> hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> 1000 <WITH> Toast)
<ADD> . LENGTH_LONG


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Replaced `Strings.get(Strings.PAINT_INDICATOR_TOAST_ID)` with `getString(R.string.hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast)`.
     - Changed the string resource ID from `PAINT_INDICATOR_TOAST_ID` to `hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast`.
     - Used `getString` instead of `Strings.get`.
     - Used `R.string` to reference the string resource.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Replaced the duration `1000` with `Toast.LENGTH_LONG`.
     - Changed the hardcoded duration to a constant from the Android SDK.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The change from `Strings.get(...)` to `getString(R.string...)` is a move toward using Android's standard resource management, which is a good practice.
     - The renaming of the string resource ID (`PAINT_INDICATOR_TOAST_ID` to `hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast`) likely reflects a naming convention change or a new string resource added to the project.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The change from `1000` to `Toast.LENGTH_LONG` is a best practice in Android development. Hardcoding durations is discouraged in favor of using constants like `Toast.LENGTH_LONG` or `Toast.LENGTH_SHORT`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The intention is to modernize the string resource handling by using Android's `getString` and `R.string` mechanism.
     - The renaming of the string resource ID likely reflects a new naming convention or a new string added to the project.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The intention is to improve code quality and maintainability by using Android's standard constants for toast duration.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are beneficial and non-conflicting in terms of logic.
   - Branch a's change improves string resource handling.
   - Branch b's change improves the use of constants for toast duration.
   - The best resolution is to combine both changes: use `getString(R.string.hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast)` for the string and `Toast.LENGTH_LONG` for the duration.

# Final Resolution
```java
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, getString(R.string.hockeyapp_paint_indicator_toast), Toast.LENGTH_LONG);
```
