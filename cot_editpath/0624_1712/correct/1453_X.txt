### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

public static final String PROSPECT_URL =
        "http://www.aemps.gob.es/cima/pdfs/es/p/#ID#/P_#ID#.pdf";
||||||| base

public static final String PROSPECT_URL =

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the `PROSPECT_URL` constant.
   - In `base`, the URL is defined in a single line.
   - In `a`, the URL is split into two lines using a newline after the assignment operator (`=`).
   - In `b`, the URL is also split into two lines, but with an additional newline before the assignment operator (`=`), making the formatting slightly different from `a`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are making formatting changes to improve readability by splitting the long string into two lines.
   - The actual content of the URL is unchanged in both branches.
   - The difference lies in the placement of the newline: `a` adds it after the `=`, while `b` adds it before the `=`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` is to improve code readability by breaking the long string into two lines.
   - Neither branch introduces any functional change to the URL itself.
   - The formatting difference is minor and likely a matter of style preference.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches aim to improve readability and the URL content is the same, the resolution should preserve the formatting change.
   - Between the two, `a`'s formatting (placing the newline after `=`) is more common in Java style guides for multi-line string assignments.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt `a`'s formatting.
