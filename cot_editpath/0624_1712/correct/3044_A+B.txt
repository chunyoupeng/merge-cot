### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> final Provider < SearchIndexer > searchIndexProvider ,
<ADD> , <newline> final Collection < Provider < TypesChangeListener > > typeChangeListeners


## From base to b
<REPLACE> MetadataException <WITH> <newline>)
<ADD> AtlasException


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the parameter `final Provider<SearchIndexer> searchIndexProvider`.
     - Added a new parameter `final Collection<Provider<TypesChangeListener>> typeChangeListeners`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Changed the exception type from `MetadataException` to `AtlasException`.
     - The constructor signature remains otherwise unchanged from the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes**:
     - Removing `searchIndexProvider` suggests that the `DefaultMetadataService` no longer needs a `SearchIndexer` provider, possibly because the indexing functionality is no longer required or is handled elsewhere.
     - Adding `typeChangeListeners` indicates a new requirement to support listeners for type changes, which could be part of an event-driven architecture or notification system.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes**:
     - Changing the exception type from `MetadataException` to `AtlasException` implies a broader or more general exception is now being thrown, possibly to align with a new exception hierarchy or naming convention in the project.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely modernizing or refactoring the service to remove outdated dependencies and introduce new functionality for type change notifications.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely part of a broader effort to standardize exception types, possibly to unify error handling across the codebase.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The removal of `searchIndexProvider` and the addition of `typeChangeListeners` from `a` are structural and functional changes that likely reflect a new design direction.
   - The exception change from `b` is a logical evolution of the error handling strategy.
   - Since both changes are non-conflicting in terms of code structure (they modify different parts of the constructor), we can merge both changes.
   - The exception type from `b` (`AtlasException`) should be used in the final constructor to reflect the updated error handling strategy.
