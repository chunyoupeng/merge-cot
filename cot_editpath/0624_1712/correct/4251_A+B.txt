### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, meaning both branches `a` and `b` added new code independently.
   - Branch `a` added a method `getLargePayload()` that retrieves a property for a large payload size in MB and converts it to bytes.
   - Branch `b` added three methods related to callback timeouts: `getCallbackTimeoutMin()`, `getCallbackTimeoutMax()`, and `getCallbackTimeoutDefault()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of changes are new and do not conflict with each other in terms of overlapping code or logic.
   - The methods in `a` and `b` serve different purposes: one is about payload size, the other is about timeout settings.
   - There is no overlap in functionality or naming, and both sets of methods are logically distinct.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to provide a utility method for calculating the large payload size in bytes based on a configuration property.
   - The intention in `b` is to provide utility methods for managing callback timeout settings with configurable defaults.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of changes are independent and do not conflict, the best resolution is to merge both sets of methods into the final code.
   - The order of the methods can be preserved as per the original branches, or reordered for clarity if needed.
   - No modifications are necessary to either set of methods.

public static long getLargePayload() {
    return HubProperties.getProperty("app.large.payload.MB", 40) * 1024 * 1024;
}

    return HubProperties.getProperty("webhook.callbackTimeoutSeconds.min", 1);
}

public static int getCallbackTimeoutMax() {

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public static long getLargePayload() {
        return HubProperties.getProperty("app.large.payload.MB", 40) * 1024 * 1024;
    }

    public static int getCallbackTimeoutMin() {
        return HubProperties.getProperty("webhook.callbackTimeoutSeconds.min", 1);
    }

    public static int getCallbackTimeoutMax() {
        return HubProperties.getProperty("webhook.callbackTimeoutSeconds.max", 1800);
