### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Map<String, QueryParser<?>> queryParsers = Maps.newHashMap();
        for (QueryParser<?> queryParser : injectedQueryParsers) {
||||||| base
Map<String, QueryParser> queryParsers = Maps.newHashMap();
        for (QueryParser queryParser : injectedQueryParsers) {
=======
Map<String, QueryParser> queryParsers = new HashMap<>();
        for (QueryParser queryParser : injectedQueryParsers) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> < ? > < ? >


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Maps <WITH> new)
<REPLACE> . <WITH> HashMap)
<REPLACE> newHashMap <WITH> <)
<ADD> >


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the generic type of `QueryParser` to `QueryParser<?>` and used `Maps.newHashMap()` (which is a Guava utility).
   - **Branch `b`** replaced `Maps.newHashMap()` with `new HashMap<>()`, which is a standard Java collection without using Guava.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a wildcard generic type (`QueryParser<?>`), which is more flexible and safer in terms of type safety when dealing with collections of unknown types.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** removes the dependency on Guava's `Maps.newHashMap()` and uses the standard Java `HashMap`, which is more portable and avoids external dependencies.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to improve type safety and flexibility by using a wildcard generic type.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to reduce or eliminate the use of Guava in favor of standard Java collections.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The wildcard generic type (`QueryParser<?>`) from branch `a` should be adopted to ensure type safety.
   - The use of `new HashMap<>()` from branch `b` should be adopted to avoid Guava dependencies.
   - Combining both changes results in a clean, type-safe, and portable solution.
