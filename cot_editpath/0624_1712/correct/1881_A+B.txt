### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

builder.generatedFolder, builder.cleanNpmFiles,
                    builder.enablePnpm);

                    builder.disablePnpm);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> disablePnpm <WITH> enablePnpm)


## From base to b
<ADD> builder . flowResourcesFolder , <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line ends with `builder.disablePnpm);`.
   - In branch `a`, the change is to replace `disablePnpm` with `enablePnpm`.
   - In branch `b`, the change is to add a new field `builder.flowResourcesFolder` before `cleanNpmFiles`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** This is a direct modification of the `disablePnpm` flag to `enablePnpm`. This likely reflects a configuration change to enable pnpm instead of disabling it.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** This introduces a new field `flowResourcesFolder`, which suggests a new configuration parameter is being added to the builder. This is an additive change and does not conflict with the existing logic unless the order of parameters matters.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to switch the pnpm behavior from disabled to enabled. This is a configuration toggle.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to add a new folder configuration (`flowResourcesFolder`) to the builder. This is an enhancement to the builder's configuration options.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are additive or modifying different parts of the same line. The `enablePnpm` change from `a` should be adopted to reflect the updated configuration.
   - The `flowResourcesFolder` from `b` should also be included to preserve the new configuration parameter.
   - The order of the parameters should be preserved as in `b` to maintain consistency with the added field.
   - Therefore, the final line should include both the new field and the updated pnpm configuration.
