### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

private static MongodExecutable tryToConfigureMongoDb(final String bindIp, final int mongoDbPort,
            final IProxyFactory proxyFactory) {

private MongodExecutable tryToConfigureMongoDb(final String bindIp, final int mongoDbPort,
            final IProxyFactory proxyFactory, final Logger logger) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> static


## From base to b
<ADD> , final Logger logger


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method `tryToConfigureMongoDb` is declared as `private MongodExecutable`.
   - In branch `a`, the method is modified to be `private static MongodExecutable`.
   - In branch `b`, the method is modified to add a new parameter `final Logger logger`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change (`static`):** Adding `static` makes the method a class-level method, which could be useful if the method does not rely on instance state and is meant to be reused without an instance. This is a structural change that affects how the method is used.
   - **Branch `b` change (`Logger logger`):** Adding a `Logger` parameter introduces a dependency on a logging mechanism, which could be used for logging during the method's execution. This is a functional enhancement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is likely to make the method reusable without needing an instance of the class, possibly for utility or helper functionality.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to add logging capability to the method, which is a common practice for debugging and monitoring.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The `static` modifier is a structural change that should be preserved if the method is intended to be used without an instance.
   - The `Logger` parameter is a functional enhancement and should also be preserved to allow for logging.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to combine both changes: make the method `static` and add the `Logger` parameter.
