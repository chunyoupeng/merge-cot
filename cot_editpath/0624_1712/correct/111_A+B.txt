### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
ObjectMapper mapper = jsonMapperBuilder()
                .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
||||||| base
ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()
                .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
=======
ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()
                .activateDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> JsonMapper <WITH> jsonMapperBuilder)
<DELETE> . builder


## From base to b
<REPLACE> enableDefaultTyping <WITH> activateDefaultTyping)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()
             .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is:
     ```java
     ObjectMapper mapper = jsonMapperBuilder()
             .enableDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
     ```
     - The change from `JsonMapper.builder()` to `jsonMapperBuilder()` suggests that `a` is using a different method to create the `ObjectMapper`, possibly a static method or a helper function.
     - The `builder` part is deleted, which implies that `jsonMapperBuilder` is a standalone method that returns a configured `ObjectMapper` or `JsonMapper.Builder`.

   - In branch `b`, the line is:
     ```java
     ObjectMapper mapper = JsonMapper.builder()
             .activateDefaultTyping(NoCheckSubTypeValidator.instance)
     ```
     - The method `enableDefaultTyping` is replaced with `activateDefaultTyping`, which could be a renamed or deprecated method.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change (`jsonMapperBuilder`)**:
     - This change suggests a refactoring or simplification of the `ObjectMapper` creation process. Instead of using the `builder()` method, it uses a helper method `jsonMapperBuilder()` that likely encapsulates the builder logic.
     - This is likely a stylistic or architectural change, not a functional one.
   - **Branch `b`'s change (`activateDefaultTyping`)**:
     - This change is more functional. It suggests that the method name has been updated, possibly due to a deprecation or a renaming in the library.
     - The method `enableDefaultTyping` may no longer be the correct or supported method, and `activateDefaultTyping` is the correct one.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to simplify or encapsulate the `ObjectMapper` creation logic, possibly for reusability or readability.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to update the method name to match the current API, ensuring correctness and compatibility with the library version being used.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method name change in `b` (`activateDefaultTyping`) is likely the correct one and should be preserved.
   - The change in `a` (`jsonMapperBuilder`) is a stylistic or architectural change that can be preserved if it aligns with the project's style.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to use `jsonMapperBuilder()` and apply the updated method name `activateDefaultTyping`.
