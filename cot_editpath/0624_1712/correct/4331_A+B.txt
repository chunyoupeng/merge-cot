### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

@ConditionalOnMissingBean(MessageSource.class)

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> Order <WITH> AutoConfigureOrder)
<ADD> @ Conditional ( ResourceBundleCondition . class ) <newline> @ EnableConfigurationProperties <newline> @ ConfigurationProperties ( prefix = " spring . messages " ) <newline>
<DELETE> implements EnvironmentAware


## From base to b
<ADD> value = , search = SearchStrategy . CURRENT


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `@Order` with `@AutoConfigureOrder`.
     - Added `@Conditional(ResourceBundleCondition.class)`, `@EnableConfigurationProperties`, and `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.messages")`.
     - Removed the `implements EnvironmentAware` interface.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Added `value=MessageSource.class, search=SearchStrategy.CURRENT` to `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`.

   The conflict occurs in the class declaration and annotations of `MessageSourceAutoConfiguration`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - `@AutoConfigureOrder` is a Spring Boot-specific annotation that is more appropriate in auto-configuration contexts than the generic `@Order`.
     - Adding `@Conditional`, `@EnableConfigurationProperties`, and `@ConfigurationProperties` aligns with Spring Boot auto-configuration best practices.
     - Removing `implements EnvironmentAware` is likely because the class no longer needs to access the environment directly.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Adding `search=SearchStrategy.CURRENT` to `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` ensures that the bean search is limited to the current context, which is a safer and more predictable behavior in complex Spring applications.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to modernize the auto-configuration class by using Spring Boot-specific annotations and removing unnecessary interfaces.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to refine the bean lookup behavior to be more precise and avoid unintended bean overrides from parent contexts.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@AutoConfigureOrder` from `a` is more appropriate than `@Order` in this context.
   - The `search=SearchStrategy.CURRENT` from `b` is a useful addition to the `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotation.
   - The annotations added by `a` (`@Conditional`, `@EnableConfigurationProperties`, `@ConfigurationProperties`) are valid and should be retained.
   - The removal of `implements EnvironmentAware` by `a` is appropriate if the class no longer needs environment access.
   - The changes from both branches are complementary and can be merged without conflict.
