### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

   public void pandocGetBibliography(String file, String csl, ServerRequestCallback<JavaScriptObject> callback)

      params.set(0, new JSONString(file));
      params.set(1, new JSONString(StringUtil.notNull(csl)));
      sendRequest(RPC_SCOPE, PANDOC_GET_BIBLIOGRAPHY, params, callback);

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different methods: `pandocGetBibliography` from branch `a` and `crossrefWorks` from branch `b`.
   - The base is empty, meaning both branches added entirely new methods independently.
   - There is no direct overlap in the code content, but the conflict arises because both branches added new methods to the same file.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `pandocGetBibliography` is a method that sends a request to get a bibliography using Pandoc. It constructs a `JSONArray` with parameters and calls `sendRequest`.
   - `crossrefWorks` is a method that sends a request to get works from Crossref. It directly calls `sendRequest` with a query.
   - Both methods are valid and serve different purposes. Neither should be discarded unless there is a reason to do so (e.g., duplication or redundancy).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to add functionality for retrieving a bibliography using Pandoc.
   - The intention of `b` is to add functionality for querying works from Crossref.
   - These are distinct features and likely serve different parts of the application.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both methods are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to keep both methods in the merged file.
   - No code overlap exists, so there is no need to modify either method.
   - The resolution should simply combine both methods into the same file without conflict.

@Override

   JSONArray params = new JSONArray();
   params.set(0, new JSONString(file));

   sendRequest(RPC_SCOPE, PANDOC_GET_BIBLIOGRAPHY, params, callback);

@Override

   sendRequest(RPC_SCOPE, CROSSREF_WORKS, query, callback);
