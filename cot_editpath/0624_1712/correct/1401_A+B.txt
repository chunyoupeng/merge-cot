### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

LocalSession session = new LocalSession(tenantName, sessionId, applicationPackage, sessionZKClient,
                                                getSessionAppDir(sessionId), applicationRepo, hostRegistry);

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> , sessionPreparer


## From base to b
<DELETE> , hostRegistry


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the constructor call for `LocalSession` includes the parameter `sessionPreparer`.
   - In branch `a`, the parameter `sessionPreparer` is removed from the constructor call.
   - In branch `b`, the parameter `hostRegistry` is removed from the constructor call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` removes `sessionPreparer`:** This suggests that the `sessionPreparer` is no longer needed for the `LocalSession` constructor in this branch. This could indicate a refactoring or simplification of the session initialization logic.
   - **Branch `b` removes `hostRegistry`:** This suggests that the `hostRegistry` is no longer required for the `LocalSession` constructor in this branch. This could also be a refactoring or a change in how host information is managed.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention appears to be to simplify the constructor by removing the `sessionPreparer`, possibly because the session is now being prepared in a different way or the preparer is no longer relevant.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention appears to be to simplify the constructor by removing the `hostRegistry`, possibly because the host registry is now being handled elsewhere or is no longer necessary for session creation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches are removing different parameters from the constructor. Since the two branches are removing different parameters and not overlapping, the best resolution is to combine both changes.
   - The final constructor call should exclude both `sessionPreparer` and `hostRegistry`, as both are no longer needed according to the changes in `a` and `b`.
   - This maintains the simplification of the constructor and aligns with the intentions of both branches.

```java
LocalSession session = new LocalSession(tenantName, sessionId, applicationPackage, sessionZKClient,
                                        getSessionAppDir(sessionId), applicationRepo);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
LocalSession session = new LocalSession(tenantName, sessionId, applicationPackage, sessionZKClient,
                                                getSessionAppDir(sessionId), applicationRepo);
