### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (objectIsRendered && ratioIsShown) {
            showSnackbar();
        }
||||||| base
showSnackbar();
=======
calculateAndShowRatio();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> if ( objectIsRendered & & ratioIsShown ) { <newline> <newline> }


## From base to b
<REPLACE> showSnackbar <WITH> calculateAndShowRatio)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, there is a single line: `showSnackbar();`.
   - In branch `a`, the code is wrapped in a conditional block: `if (objectIsRendered && ratioIsShown) { showSnackbar(); }`.
   - In branch `b`, the function call is changed from `showSnackbar()` to `calculateAndShowRatio()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a conditional check before calling `showSnackbar()`. This suggests that the intention is to only show the snackbar when both `objectIsRendered` and `ratioIsShown` are true. This is a logical guard to prevent unnecessary or incorrect behavior.
   - **Branch `b`** replaces the function call with `calculateAndShowRatio()`, which implies that the intention is to perform a calculation before showing the snackbar. This could be a more complex or updated version of the original behavior.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to add a condition to control when the snackbar is shown.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to change the behavior of the snackbar to include a calculation step.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The conditional logic from `a` ensures the snackbar is shown only when appropriate, and the function call from `b` ensures the correct behavior is executed.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to combine both changes: apply the conditional logic from `a` and use the updated function call from `b`.
