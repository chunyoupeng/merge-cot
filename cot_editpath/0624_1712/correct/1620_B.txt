### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in a comment-style line of code, likely in a documentation or markdown file.
   - In the `base` version, the lines are:
     ```
     *     Handles statistics on tip selection.
         *     Increases the tip selection by one use.
         * </p>
     ```
     Here, the lines have multiple leading spaces before the asterisks.
   - In `a`, the changes are:
     ```
     * Handles statistics on tip selection.
         * Increases the tip selection by one use.
         * </p>
     ```
     Here, the leading spaces before the first asterisk are reduced.
   - In `b`, the changes are:
     ```
     * Handles statistics on tip selection. 
         * Increases the tip selection by one use.
         * </p>
     ```
     Here, the first line has a space before the period at the end of the sentence.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` removes extra leading spaces before the first bullet point, making the formatting more consistent with standard markdown or comment conventions.
   - `b` adds a space before the period in the first line, which is not standard and may be a typo or formatting inconsistency.
   - The second bullet point in both `a` and `b` is consistent with the base in terms of indentation and content.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` likely aimed to clean up the formatting by removing unnecessary spaces for consistency.
   - `b` may have intended to improve readability or fix a typo, but the added space before the period is not standard and could be an error.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most consistent and clean formatting is found in `a`, where unnecessary leading spaces are removed.
   - The space before the period in `b` should be removed as it is not standard.
   - The second bullet point is consistent across all versions and should remain unchanged.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the formatting from `a` and remove the space before the period from `b`.
