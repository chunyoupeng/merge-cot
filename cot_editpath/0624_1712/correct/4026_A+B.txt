### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , getReadTimeout ( ) , getConnectionTimeout ( )


## From base to b
<ADD> ( ) , getMaxConsecutiveErrors


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the constructor call to `ElasticSearchConfiguration`.
   - **Branch a** added two new parameters: `getReadTimeout()` and `getConnectionTimeout()`.
   - **Branch b** added a new parameter: `getMaxConsecutiveErrors()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's changes:** Adding `getReadTimeout()` and `getConnectionTimeout()` likely introduces support for configuring timeouts in the connection and read operations. These are common parameters in network-related configurations and are likely intended to improve robustness and control over the connection behavior.
   - **Branch b's change:** Adding `getMaxConsecutiveErrors()` likely introduces a mechanism to control how many consecutive errors are allowed before some action is taken (e.g., retrying or failing). This is also a reasonable and useful addition for robustness.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To enhance the configuration by allowing timeout settings for connection and read operations.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To enhance the configuration by allowing a threshold for consecutive errors, which can be used for error-handling logic.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are additive and do not conflict with each other in terms of parameter order or logic.
   - The order of parameters in the constructor call should be preserved as per the original base, with the new parameters added in the order they were introduced by the respective branches.
   - Since both branches added new parameters, the final constructor call should include all of them.

# Final Resolution

```java
return new ElasticSearchConfiguration(getInclusionPolicies(), initializeUntil(), getProtocol(), getUri(), getPort(), keyProperty, isRetryOnError(), getMaxConsecutiveErrors(), getQueueCapacity(), getReindexBatchSize(), isExecuteBulk(), getAuthUser(), getAuthPassword(), getMapping(), isAsyncIndexation(), getReadTimeout(), getConnectionTimeout());
```
