### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> mapper <WITH> final)
<ADD> CharacterBean charBean = MAPPER
<REPLACE> disable <WITH> readerFor)
<ADD> ( CharacterBean . class ) <newline> . without
<DELETE> ; final CharacterBean charBean = MAPPER , CharacterBean . class


## From base to b
<REPLACE> mapper <WITH> final)
<ADD> CharacterBean charBean = MAPPER
<REPLACE> disable <WITH> readerFor)
<ADD> ( CharacterBean . class ) <newline> . without
<DELETE> ; final CharacterBean charBean = MAPPER , CharacterBean . class


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code disables the `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` feature on the `mapper` and then deserializes a JSON string into a `CharacterBean`.
   - Both `a` and `b` modify the base in a similar way:
     - They replace `mapper.disable(...)` with `MAPPER.readerFor(...)`.
     - They add a `final` keyword to the `charBean` variable.
     - They use the `without(...)` method to disable the same feature.
     - They use a more explicit `readerFor(...).without(...).readValue(...)` pattern instead of the simpler `readValue(...)`.

   The main conflict is that both `a` and `b` have made the same changes to the base, but the merge tool is unable to reconcile the identical changes due to the way the edits are structured in the file.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The use of `readerFor(...).without(...).readValue(...)` is more explicit and modular, which is a good practice when dealing with deserialization features.
   - Adding the `final` keyword is a stylistic improvement that can help prevent accidental reassignment.
   - The changes in both `a` and `b` are semantically and stylistically equivalent. There is no functional difference between the two branches.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` aim to improve the clarity and correctness of the deserialization process by using a more explicit method chain and adding the `final` keyword.
   - The intention is to make the code more readable and maintainable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` have made the same changes, the resolution is to keep one of the versions (either `a` or `b`), as they are functionally and stylistically equivalent.
   - The most appropriate resolution is to adopt the version from either `a` or `b`, as they are identical in effect.

```java
final CharacterBean charBean = MAPPER.readerFor(CharacterBean.class)
                .without(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES)
                .readValue("{\"v\":null}");
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
final CharacterBean charBean = MAPPER.readerFor(CharacterBean.class)
                .without(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES)
                .readValue("{\"v\":null}");
