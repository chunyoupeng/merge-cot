### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict arises because both branches `a` and `b` added new constants and default values to the file, but they added different sets of constants.
   - Branch `a` added constants related to feed servers and Java options for components like `cc` and `nc`.
   - Branch `b` added a constant related to waiting for an active cluster.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes:**
     - `EXTERNAL_FEEDSERVER_KEY` and `EXTERNAL_FEEDSERVER_DEFAULT`: These define a key and default port for an external feed server. This is likely part of a configuration system for external services.
     - `EXTERNAL_CC_JAVA_OPTS_KEY` and `EXTERNAL_CC_JAVA_OPTS_DEFAULT`: These define Java options for a component (`cc`), likely for memory allocation.
     - `EXTERNAL_NC_JAVA_OPTS_KEY` and `EXTERNAL_NC_JAVA_OPTS_DEFAULT`: Similar to the above, but for another component (`nc`).
     - These changes are likely part of a broader configuration system for external services and their associated Java components.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:**
     - `EXTERNAL_MAX_WAIT_FOR_ACTIVE_CLUSTER` and `EXTERNAL_MAX_WAIT_FOR_ACTIVE_CLUSTER_DEFAULT`: This defines a timeout for waiting for a cluster to become active. This is likely part of a system that waits for a cluster to be ready before proceeding with operations.
     - This change is likely part of a cluster management or orchestration system.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To configure external services and their associated Java components with specific defaults.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To configure a timeout for waiting for a cluster to become active, likely to avoid hanging or waiting indefinitely.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both sets of changes are likely to be part of different but related systems (external services and cluster management).
   - Since the constants are unrelated and serve different purposes, there is no overlap or conflict in the logic.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of changes** into a single file, preserving all constants and their defaults.
   - The order of the constants can be preserved as in the original branches to maintain clarity and context.
