### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> InMemoryTable <WITH> int)
<REPLACE> cachedTable <WITH> cacheMode)
<ADD> = CACHE_MODE_BASIC_PRELOAD ; <newline> private long cacheExpiryCheckIntervalInMillis
<REPLACE> isCacheEnabled <WITH> cacheEnabled)
<ADD> <newline> private boolean cacheExpiryEnabled = false ; <newline> private InMemoryTable cacheTable ;


## From base to b
<DELETE> private int currentCacheSize = 0 ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, we have:
     ```java
     private int currentCacheSize = 0;
     private InMemoryTable cachedTable;
     private boolean isCacheEnabled = false;
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the following changes are made:
     - `InMemoryTable cachedTable` is replaced with `int cacheMode = CACHE_MODE_BASIC_PRELOAD;`
     - A new field `private long cacheExpiryCheckIntervalInMillis;` is added.
     - `isCacheEnabled` is renamed to `cacheEnabled`.
     - New fields `private boolean cacheExpiryEnabled = false;` and `private InMemoryTable cacheTable;` are added.
   - In branch `b`, the field `private int currentCacheSize = 0;` is deleted.

   The conflict arises because both branches have modified the same region of the code, but in different ways:
   - `a` introduces new fields and renames variables.
   - `b` removes a field.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` introduces a more detailed caching configuration system:
     - `cacheMode` allows for different caching strategies.
     - `cacheExpiryCheckIntervalInMillis` and `cacheExpiryEnabled` suggest support for cache expiration logic.
     - `cacheTable` is likely a new or renamed version of `cachedTable`.
     - `cacheEnabled` is a renamed version of `isCacheEnabled`.
   - `b` removes `currentCacheSize`, which might indicate that the feature is no longer needed or is being handled elsewhere.

   The intention of `a` seems to be to enhance the caching system with more configuration options and expiration logic.
   The intention of `b` seems to be to simplify the code by removing a field that is no longer necessary.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` is likely adding more advanced caching features, such as different modes and expiration.
   - `b` is likely removing a field that is no longer used or is being handled in a different way.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The field `currentCacheSize` is removed in `b`, but `a` keeps it. Since `b` removes it, we should consider whether it is still needed. If the caching system is being simplified, it might be safe to remove it.
   - The renaming of `isCacheEnabled` to `cacheEnabled` is a minor change and should be kept.
   - The addition of `cacheMode`, `cacheExpiryCheckIntervalInMillis`, and `cacheExpiryEnabled` are new features that enhance the caching system and should be kept.
   - The renaming of `cachedTable` to `cacheTable` is a minor change and should be kept.
   - The final resolution should include the new features from `a` and the removal of `currentCacheSize` from `b`.

# Final Resolution

```java
    private int cacheMode = CACHE_MODE_BASIC_PRELOAD;
    private long cacheExpiryCheckIntervalInMillis;
    private boolean cacheEnabled = false;
    private boolean cacheExpiryEnabled = false;
    private InMemoryTable cacheTable;
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
private int cacheMode = CACHE_MODE_BASIC_PRELOAD;
    private long cacheExpiryCheckIntervalInMillis;
    private boolean cacheEnabled = false;
    private boolean cacheExpiryEnabled = false;
    private InMemoryTable cacheTable;
