### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public void incrementUsage(ShortUrl shortUrl, RequestInfo info,
      long incrBy) throws IOException {
||||||| base
public void incrementUsage(ShortUrl shortUrl, RequestInfo info, long incrBy)
      throws IOException {
=======
public void incrementUsage(ShortUrl shortUrl, RequestInfo info, long incrBy)
  throws IOException {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the method signature of `incrementUsage`.
   - **Branch a** has a method signature with a newline after the parameter list and before the `throws IOException` clause.
   - **Branch b** has the same method signature as the base, with a newline after the method name and before the parameter list.
   - The base version has a newline after the method name and before the parameter list.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** added a newline before the `throws IOException` clause. This is a formatting change and does not affect functionality.
   - **Branch b** did not change the method signature compared to the base.
   - The change in **branch a** is purely stylistic and does not affect the logic or correctness of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely intended to improve code formatting by separating the `throws` clause onto a new line for readability.
   - **Branch b** did not intend to change the method signature, so its intention is to preserve the original formatting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the only difference is a formatting change in **branch a**, and formatting can be subjective, the resolution should preserve the formatting from **branch a** if the team prefers that style. However, if the team prefers the base or **branch b** style, that could also be chosen.
   - For consistency and to reflect the formatting change from **branch a**, the final resolution will adopt the formatting from **branch a**.
