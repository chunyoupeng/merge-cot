### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Promise<DeferredVoid> assertMessageContextActive();
||||||| base

=======
Promise<Deferred<Object[]>> testMultiOutMethod();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**  
   - In the base, there is no content (base is empty).  
   - In branch `a`, a new method `assertMessageContextActive()` is introduced, which returns a `Promise<DeferredVoid>`.  
   - In branch `b`, a new method `testMultiOutMethod()` is introduced, which returns a `Promise<Deferred<Object[]>>`.  
   - The conflict arises because both branches independently added new methods to the same file, and Git cannot determine which one to keep or how to merge them.

2. **Evaluate each change:**  
   - Both methods appear to be test or utility methods related to asynchronous operations (`Promise` and `Deferred` suggest asynchronous behavior).  
   - Since the base is empty, there is no overlap in the code being modified—each branch added a completely new method.  
   - Neither method seems to conflict with the other in terms of functionality or naming.  
   - Both changes are likely valid and should be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**  
   - The intention in `a` seems to be to add a method that asserts or verifies the active state of a message context, likely for testing or validation purposes.  
   - The intention in `b` seems to be to add a method that tests a multi-output method, likely for testing a function that returns multiple values or results.  
   - Both changes are likely part of test or utility code and are not mutually exclusive.

4. **Final decision:**  
   - Since both branches added new methods to an otherwise empty file, and there is no overlap or conflict in the code, the correct resolution is to merge both methods into the final file.  
   - No changes need to be made to either method—both can coexist in the final file.  
   - The resolution should include both `assertMessageContextActive()` and `testMultiOutMethod()` in the final code.
