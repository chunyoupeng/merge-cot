### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

splitBlockSize = config.getInt(SPLIT_BLOCK_SIZE,DEFAULT_SPLIT_BLOCK_SIZE);

controlSideCostThreshold = SpliceConstants.config.getDouble(CONTROL_SIDE_COST_THRESHOLD, DEFAULT_CONTROL_SIDE_COST_THRESHOLD);
        controlSideRowCountThreshold = SpliceConstants.config.getDouble(CONTROL_SIDE_ROWCOUNT_THRESHOLD, DEFAULT_CONTROL_SIDE_ROWCOUNT_THRESHOLD);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added new lines of code to a previously empty base.
   - Branch `a` introduces a line to read a configuration value for `splitBlockSize`.
   - Branch `b` introduces two lines to read configuration values for `controlSideCostThreshold` and `controlSideRowCountThreshold`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are adding configuration parameters, which are likely used for different purposes in the codebase.
   - The `splitBlockSize` is likely related to data splitting logic, while the `controlSideCostThreshold` and `controlSideRowCountThreshold` are likely related to cost and row count thresholds for some control logic (e.g., in a join or optimization algorithm).
   - Since these are distinct configuration parameters, they do not conflict in terms of overlapping logic or variable names.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to introduce a configuration parameter for block size in data splitting.
   - The intention of `b` is to introduce two configuration parameters for cost and row count thresholds in some control logic.
   - These intentions are orthogonal and do not interfere with each other.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding new configuration parameters and there is no overlap or conflict in the code, the correct resolution is to merge both changes.
   - The final code should include all three configuration parameters: `splitBlockSize`, `controlSideCostThreshold`, and `controlSideRowCountThreshold`.
   - The order of the lines can be preserved as in the original branches, or adjusted for readability if needed.

```java
splitBlockSize = config.getInt(SPLIT_BLOCK_SIZE, DEFAULT_SPLIT_BLOCK_SIZE);
controlSideCostThreshold = SpliceConstants.config.getDouble(CONTROL_SIDE_COST_THRESHOLD, DEFAULT_CONTROL_SIDE_COST_THRESHOLD);
controlSideRowCountThreshold = SpliceConstants.config.getDouble(CONTROL_SIDE_ROWCOUNT_THRESHOLD, DEFAULT_CONTROL_SIDE_ROWCOUNT_THRESHOLD);
```
