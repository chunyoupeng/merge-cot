### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

public void onFoundEdition(long l, USK key, ObjectContainer container, ClientContext context, boolean wasMetadata, short codec, byte[] data) {
||||||| base
public void onFoundEdition(long l, USK key){

public void onFoundEdition(long l, USK key) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , ObjectContainer container , ClientContext context , boolean wasMetadata , short codec , byte [ ] data



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The method `onFoundEdition` in the base version has the signature: `public void onFoundEdition(long l, USK key)`.
   - In branch `a`, the method signature is extended with several additional parameters: `ObjectContainer container`, `ClientContext context`, `boolean wasMetadata`, `short codec`, and `byte[] data`.
   - In branch `b`, no changes are shown in the provided code snippet, so it appears that `b` has not modified the method signature.
   - The conflict arises because `a` has added multiple parameters to the method, while `b` has not changed it.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The addition of parameters in `a` likely reflects an expansion of functionality, possibly to handle more detailed metadata or data processing.
   - Since `b` has not modified the method signature, it is likely that `b`'s implementation of `onFoundEdition` is still compatible with the base version.
   - However, if `a`'s changes are necessary for new functionality, they should be preserved. If `b`'s version is expected to work with the updated method, it may need to be updated accordingly.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to enhance the method with additional context and data parameters, likely to support more complex operations.
   - The intention in `b` is unclear from the provided information, but it appears that no changes were made to the method signature.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` has added necessary parameters for extended functionality and `b` has not modified the method, the best resolution is to keep the updated method signature from `a`.
   - This ensures that the method can support the new functionality introduced in `a`, and `b` can be updated to match the new signature if needed.
