### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in a code block that appends some C-like code to a `StringBuilder` (`builder`) if the compiler is not "arduino".
   - The content in `base`, `a`, and `b` is nearly identical:
     - All versions have the same conditional check: `if (ctx.getCompiler().getID().compareTo("arduino") != 0)`
     - All versions append the same lines:
       - `int emptyEventConsumed = 1;`
       - `while (emptyEventConsumed != 0) {`
       - `emptyEventConsumed = 0;`
   - The only difference is the indentation level of the code inside the `if` block:
     - `base` and `b` use 8 spaces of indentation.
     - `a` uses 12 spaces of indentation.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The logic and content of the code are identical across all versions.
   - The only difference is the indentation level, which is a **style** issue and does not affect the correctness or behavior of the code.
   - Indentation in `a` is more than in `base` and `b`, but this is likely due to a formatting preference or tooling difference.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` and `b` appears to be the same: to maintain the same logic and structure of the code.
   - The change in indentation in `a` is likely unintentional or a formatting artifact (e.g., from an IDE or linter).
   - There is no evidence that either `a` or `b` made a functional change to the code.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the logic and content are identical, the only conflict is in indentation.
   - The resolution should preserve the logic and choose a consistent indentation style.
   - Given that `base` and `b` use 8 spaces and `a` uses 12, it is reasonable to adopt the indentation from `base` and `b` (8 spaces) for consistency.
   - Alternatively, if the team prefers 12 spaces, that could be adopted as well, but the key is to maintain consistency.
   - Since the code is already well-formed and the only conflict is in indentation, the resolution is straightforward.
