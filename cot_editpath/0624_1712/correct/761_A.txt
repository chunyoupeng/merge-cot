### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> " + domName + " " + <newline> " {
<ADD> { } : { } @ { }
<REPLACE> + <WITH> ,)
<ADD> <newline> domName ,

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the string concatenation with a formatted string using placeholders `{}`.
     - Changed the order of the log message to: `domName`, `IP-ENABLED/DISABLED`, `ipAddress.getIp()`, `ipAddress.getPort()`, `ipAddress.getClusterName()`.
     - Used a more structured format with commas and parentheses for the arguments.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Appears to be identical to the base in the provided code snippet. No visible changes are shown in the diff for `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The use of a formatted string (`{}`) is more readable and maintainable than string concatenation.
     - The order of the log message is more logical and consistent with typical logging formats.
     - The structured format with commas and parentheses is more robust and less error-prone.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - No changes are visible in the provided code snippet, so there is no conflict to resolve with `b`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to improve the readability and maintainability of the logging statement.
     - The structured format is likely intended to make the log message more consistent and easier to parse.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - No changes are visible, so there is no intention to resolve with `b`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b` appears to be identical to the base and no changes are visible in the provided code snippet, the conflict is only between `a` and the base.
   - The changes in `a` are beneficial and should be kept.
   - The final resolution should adopt the formatted string and structured format from `a`.

# Final Resolution

```java
Loggers.EVT_LOG.info("{} {SYNC} IP-{} : {}@{}",
                    domName, (ipAddress.isValid() ? "ENABLED" : "DISABLED"),
                    ipAddress.getIp(), ipAddress.getPort(), ipAddress.getClusterName());
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
Loggers.EVT_LOG.info("{} {SYNC} IP-{} : {}@{}",
                    domName, (ipAddress.isValid() ? "ENABLED" : "DISABLED"),
                    ipAddress.getIp(), ipAddress.getPort(), ipAddress.getClusterName());
