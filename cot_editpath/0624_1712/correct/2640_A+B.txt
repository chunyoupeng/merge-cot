### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

LOG.lifecycle("Applying VersionUpgradeConsumerPlugin, beware that it's is INCUBATING state, so its API may change!");
        final GitRemoteOriginPlugin gitOriginPlugin = project.getPlugins().apply(GitRemoteOriginPlugin.class);
        final GitAuthPlugin.GitAuth gitAuth = project.getPlugins().apply(GitAuthPlugin.class).getGitAuth();

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> final GitRemoteOriginPlugin gitOriginPlugin = project . getPlugins ( ) . apply ( GitRemoteOriginPlugin . class ) ; <newline> final GitAuthPlugin . GitAuth gitAuth = project . getPlugins ( ) . apply ( GitAuthPlugin . class ) . getGitAuth ( ) ;


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Applying <WITH> [)
<ADD> INCUBATING ]
<DELETE> , beware that it ' s
<REPLACE> INCUBATING <WITH> incubating)
<REPLACE> state <WITH> and)
<DELETE> , so !


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** added two lines of code:
     - `final GitRemoteOriginPlugin gitOriginPlugin = project.getPlugins().apply(GitRemoteOriginPlugin.class);`
     - `final GitAuthPlugin.GitAuth gitAuth = project.getPlugins().apply(GitAuthPlugin.class).getGitAuth();`
   - **Branch b** modified the log message:
     - Changed the message from `"Applying VersionUpgradeConsumerPlugin, beware that it's is INCUBATING state, so its API may change!"` to `"  [INCUBATING] VersionUpgradeConsumerPlugin is incubating and its API may change"`.
     - This includes:
       - Adding indentation and brackets (`[INCUBATING]`).
       - Removing the phrase `"wary that it's is"` and the word `"state"`.
       - Replacing `"INCUBATING"` with `"incubating"` and `"state"` with `"and"`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's changes:**
     - These are functional additions that apply two plugins (`GitRemoteOriginPlugin` and `GitAuthPlugin`) and store their instances.
     - These changes are likely necessary for the plugin to function correctly.
   - **Branch b's changes:**
     - These are stylistic and message formatting changes.
     - The message is more concise and avoids redundancy (e.g., removing `"wary that it's is"`).
     - The message is also more consistent with common Gradle plugin warning styles (e.g., using `[INCUBATING]` as a prefix).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To add functionality by applying two plugins and storing their instances for later use.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To improve the clarity and style of the log message, making it more concise and aligned with common Gradle practices.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are important and serve different purposes.
   - The message from **branch b** is more concise and stylistically appropriate.
   - The functional additions from **branch a** are necessary for the plugin to work.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both the updated message from **branch b** and the functional additions from **branch a**.

# Final resolution
```java
LOG.lifecycle("  [INCUBATING] VersionUpgradeConsumerPlugin is incubating and its API may change");
final GitRemoteOriginPlugin gitOriginPlugin = project.getPlugins().apply(GitRemoteOriginPlugin.class);
final GitAuthPlugin.GitAuth gitAuth = project.getPlugins().apply(GitAuthPlugin.class).getGitAuth();
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
LOG.lifecycle("  [INCUBATING] VersionUpgradeConsumerPlugin is incubating and its API may change");
        final GitRemoteOriginPlugin gitOriginPlugin = project.getPlugins().apply(GitRemoteOriginPlugin.class);
        final GitAuthPlugin.GitAuth gitAuth = project.getPlugins().apply(GitAuthPlugin.class).getGitAuth();
