### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

public FromInt32ToInt32(TClass source, TClass target, boolean auto, Constantness c)
||||||| base
public FromInt32ToInt32(MNumeric source, MNumeric target, boolean auto, Constantness c)

public FromInt32ToInt32(TClass source, MNumeric target, boolean auto, Constantness c)
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> MNumeric <WITH> TClass)
<REPLACE> MNumeric <WITH> TClass)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> MNumeric <WITH> TClass)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code has the method signature:  
     `public FromInt32ToInt32(MNumeric source, MNumeric target, boolean auto, Constantness c)`
   - Branch `a` changes both `source` and `target` from `MNumeric` to `TClass`:  
     `public FromInt32ToInt32(TClass source, TClass target, boolean auto, Constantness c)`
   - Branch `b` changes only the `source` from `MNumeric` to `TClass`, while `target` remains `MNumeric`:  
     `public FromInt32ToInt32(TClass source, MNumeric target, boolean auto, Constantness c)`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** makes a more aggressive change by generalizing both parameters to `TClass`. This could indicate an intention to make the method more flexible or generic.
   - **Branch `b`** makes a more conservative change by generalizing only the `source` parameter. This might suggest that the `target` should still be a specific numeric type, possibly for type safety or compatibility reasons.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to make the method fully generic, allowing both `source` and `target` to be any `TClass` type. This could be useful in a broader context where the method is used with various types.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to generalize the `source` but keep the `target` as a numeric type, possibly to ensure that the target is always a numeric type for correctness or performance reasons.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most logical resolution is to adopt the change from **branch `a`**, where both parameters are generalized to `TClass`. This aligns with the intention of making the method fully generic and consistent with the broader design goal of flexibility.
   - However, if there is a strong reason to keep the `target` as a numeric type (e.g., for type safety or performance), then the change from **branch `b`** could be more appropriate.
   - Given the information provided, and assuming the goal is to maximize flexibility, the resolution should adopt the fully generalized version from branch `a`.
