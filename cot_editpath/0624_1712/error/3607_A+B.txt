### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> @ Override <newline> public void bindAdapter ( Connection adapter ) { <newline> m_ci . bindAdapter ( adapter ) ; <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code contains three overridden methods: `setSendHeartbeats`, `sendHeartbeat`, and `isOnBackPressure`. These methods are all stubbed out with no-op implementations, indicating that the feature (heartbeating and backpressure) is not required in the current implementation (Iv2).
   - **Branch a** has removed all the content from the base. This means that the entire block of code (the three overridden methods) is deleted in branch a.
   - **Branch b** adds a new overridden method `bindAdapter(Connection adapter)` that calls `m_ci.bindAdapter(adapter)`. This is a new method not present in the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change:** Removing the three methods implies that the feature (heartbeating and backpressure) is no longer relevant or needed. However, this is a destructive change and could lead to a loss of functionality if the methods are used elsewhere.
   - **Branch b's change:** Adding the `bindAdapter` method introduces a new feature or integration point. It is a constructive and specific change that does not conflict with the existing code in the base.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** Likely to remove unused or obsolete code related to heartbeating and backpressure, which are not required in Iv2.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To add a new method for binding an adapter, which may be part of a new feature or integration.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch a removes all the existing methods, it is a destructive change that could remove functionality that may still be needed.
   - Branch b adds a new method that does not conflict with the existing code and introduces a new feature.
   - The best resolution is to keep the new method from branch b and retain the existing methods from the base. This preserves the existing behavior while incorporating the new functionality.

```java
@Override
public void setSendHeartbeats(boolean val)
{
    // Iv2 does not require heartbeating.
}

@Override
public void sendHeartbeat(long txnId)
{
    // Iv2 does not require heartbeating.
}

@Override
public boolean isOnBackPressure()
{
    return false;
}

@Override
public void bindAdapter(Connection adapter) {
    m_ci.bindAdapter(adapter);
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
@Override
    public void bindAdapter(Connection adapter) {
        m_ci.bindAdapter(adapter);
    }
