### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

if (!fileDownloadInfo.isNoIntegrity() && noSizeInfo) {
            throw new StopRequestException(DownloadsStatus.STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME, "can't know size of download, giving up");
||||||| base

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> DownloadsStatus .


## From base to b
<REPLACE> fileDownloadInfo <WITH> originalDownloadInfo)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the condition is:
     ```java
     if (!fileDownloadInfo.isNoIntegrity() && noSizeInfo) {
         throw new StopRequestException(STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME, "can't know size of download, giving up");
     }
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the `STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME` is changed to `DownloadsStatus.STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME`, indicating a namespace or class qualification was added.
   - In branch `b`, `fileDownloadInfo` is replaced with `originalDownloadInfo`, suggesting a variable name change or a logic shift to use a different object.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change:** Adding the class name `DownloadsStatus` to qualify the constant `STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME` is likely a refactoring to make the code more explicit or to resolve a naming conflict. This is a common practice in Java to avoid ambiguity.
   - **Branch `b` change:** Replacing `fileDownloadInfo` with `originalDownloadInfo` could indicate a shift in logic where the original download information is being used instead of the current file download info. This might be due to a design change where the original state is preserved for integrity checks.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to make the code more robust by explicitly referencing the constant with its class name, likely to avoid conflicts or to follow a new coding standard.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to use a different variable (`originalDownloadInfo`) for the integrity check, possibly to ensure that the original download metadata is used for validation, not the current or modified one.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The variable name change in `b` is likely more critical to the logic of the condition, as it determines which object is used for the integrity check.
   - The class qualification in `a` is a syntactic improvement and can be applied on top of the variable change.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to use `originalDownloadInfo` from `b` and apply the class qualification from `a` to the constant.

```java
if (!originalDownloadInfo.isNoIntegrity() && noSizeInfo) {
    throw new StopRequestException(DownloadsStatus.STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME, "can't know size of download, giving up");
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
if (!originalDownloadInfo.isNoIntegrity() && noSizeInfo) {
            throw new StopRequestException(DownloadsStatus.STATUS_CANNOT_RESUME, "can't know size of download, giving up");
