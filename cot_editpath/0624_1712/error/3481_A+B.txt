### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> <newline> public static Object load ( String fileName ) throws ObjectStreamException , IOException { <newline> try ( ObjectInputStream deserializer <newline> = new ObjectInputStream ( new BufferedInputStream ( new FileInputStream ( fileName ) ) ) ) { <newline> return deserializer . readObject ( ) ; <newline> } catch ( ClassNotFoundException e ) { <newline> throw new AssertionError ( " Something wrong with deserialization " , e ) ; <newline> } <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> public static Object loadWithThrow ( String fileName ) throws IOException , ClassNotFoundException { <newline> try ( ObjectInputStream deserializer <newline> = new ObjectInputStream ( new BufferedInputStream ( new FileInputStream ( fileName ) ) ) ) { <newline> return deserializer . readObject ( ) ; <newline> } <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new method `load` that:
     - Throws `ObjectStreamException` and `IOException`.
     - Catches `ClassNotFoundException` and wraps it in an `AssertionError`.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new method `loadWithThrow` that:
     - Throws `IOException` and `ClassNotFoundException`.
     - Does not handle `ClassNotFoundException` and instead rethrows it.
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new method with similar functionality but different names and exception handling strategies.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s `load` method**:
     - Introduces a more defensive approach by wrapping `ClassNotFoundException` in an `AssertionError`, which is appropriate if the method is expected to never encounter such an error.
     - The method name `load` is concise and descriptive.
   - **Branch `b`'s `loadWithThrow` method**:
     - Provides a more transparent approach by allowing `ClassNotFoundException` to propagate.
     - The method name `loadWithThrow` is less concise and implies a side effect rather than a function.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to ensure that the method is robust and fails fast if an unexpected exception occurs.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to provide a more flexible interface where the caller can handle `ClassNotFoundException` explicitly.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both methods serve different purposes and can coexist.
   - However, since the method names differ (`load` vs. `loadWithThrow`), the conflict is not in the same method but in the addition of two new methods.
   - The best resolution is to merge both methods, ensuring that the code includes both `load` and `loadWithThrow` with their respective exception handling strategies.
   - This preserves the flexibility and robustness of both approaches.

            return deserializer.readObject();
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            throw new AssertionError("Something wrong with deserialization", e);
