### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two new options added by `a` and `b`.
   - `a` added three options related to information flow analysis:
     - `infoFlow`: A flag to enable information flow analysis.
     - `infoFlowDotFile`: An option to export information flows to a DOT file.
     - `infoFlowDotMethod`: An option to export information flows for a specific method.
   - `b` added one new option:
     - `runStringAnalysis`: A flag to run string analysis.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s changes are focused on enabling and customizing information flow analysis, which is a specific type of static analysis.
   - `b`'s change introduces a completely different analysis type: string analysis.
   - Both sets of changes are orthogonal and serve different purposes. There is no overlap or conflict in the functionality they introduce.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a`'s intention is to provide detailed control over information flow analysis, including the ability to export results in DOT format and focus on specific methods.
   - `b`'s intention is to add a new analysis mode for string analysis, which is likely a separate static analysis technique.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the two sets of changes are orthogonal and do not conflict, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes.
   - This means including all four options in the final code: the three from `a` and the one from `b`.
   - The code should be updated to include all the new options without any modification, as they serve different purposes and do not interfere with each other.
