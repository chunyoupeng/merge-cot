### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `a`, the method `purgeOrphanedDriftFiles` has been modified by adding a new parameter `long purgeMillis`.
   - In `b`, the method `purgeOrphanedDriftFiles` remains unchanged, but a new method `getDriftFileBits` has been added with a full Javadoc comment.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` introduces a new parameter to the `purgeOrphanedDriftFiles` method, likely to allow for more flexible purging behavior (e.g., specifying a time threshold for purging).
   - The change in `b` introduces a new method `getDriftFileBits` with a detailed Javadoc comment, which is a clean and well-documented addition.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to enhance the `purgeOrphanedDriftFiles` method by allowing it to accept a time-based threshold for purging.
   - The intention in `b` is to add a new utility method for retrieving drift file content, with proper documentation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The addition of the `purgeMillis` parameter in `a` should be preserved to allow for more flexible purging logic.
   - The new method `getDriftFileBits` from `b` should also be preserved as it adds functionality and is well-documented.
   - The conflict is resolved by combining both changes: updating the method signature in `purgeOrphanedDriftFiles` and adding the new method `getDriftFileBits`.

int purgeOrphanedDriftFiles(Subject subject, long purgeMillis);
