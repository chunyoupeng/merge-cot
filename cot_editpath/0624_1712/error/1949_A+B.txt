### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the `percentilesField` method.
   - **Branch a** introduces a method with the following parameters: `String label, String name, FieldSpecificationBuilder valueFieldBulder, List<SubjectSpecificationBuilder> normalizationSubjects, Integer percentileCount, Boolean inverse`.
     - It sets additional fields: `name`, `valueField`, and `normalizationSubjects`.
   - **Branch b** introduces a method with the following parameters: `String label, Integer percentileCount, Boolean inverse`.
     - It only sets `percentileCount` and `inverse`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** adds more parameters and sets more fields in the `FieldSpecificationBuilder`. This suggests an intention to expand the functionality of the method to include more configuration options.
   - **Branch b** keeps the method minimal, focusing only on `label`, `percentileCount`, and `inverse`. This suggests a simpler or more streamlined use case.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely aims to provide a more flexible and comprehensive method for building `PercentilesField` with additional configuration options.
   - **Branch b** likely aims to keep the method simple and focused on the core parameters needed for the `PercentilesField`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches aim to define the `percentilesField` method but with different sets of parameters and functionality, the best approach is to merge the parameters and functionality from both branches.
   - The final method should include all the parameters from both branches to ensure maximum flexibility and functionality.
   - The order of parameters should be logical, grouping related parameters together.
   - The method should set all the fields from both branches to ensure that all configurations are included.

            List<SubjectSpecificationBuilder> normalizationSubjects,

        FieldSpecificationBuilder spec = new FieldSpecificationBuilder();
