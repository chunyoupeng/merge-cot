### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the `break;` statement from the original `case Constants.EPSG`.
     - Replaced the `case` statement with an `else if (key.equals(Constants.EPSG))` block.
     - This suggests a shift from a switch-case structure to an if-else structure, likely to allow more flexible conditional logic based on `key.equals(...)`.

   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a new `case Constants.IOGP` before the existing `case Constants.EPSG`.
     - The new case sets up a citation for IOGP, including a title, code, copyFrom, and presentation form.
     - This is a new feature addition, not a structural change like in `a`.

   - **Conflict Point**:
     - The conflict occurs at the `case Constants.EPSG` block. `a` is trying to convert it into an `if-else` condition, while `b` is adding a new case before it.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change from `case Constants.EPSG` to `else if (key.equals(Constants.EPSG))` is a structural change. It implies that the logic is no longer switch-case based and is now conditionally evaluated.
     - This change might be necessary if the logic is evolving to handle more complex conditions or if `key` is not a constant but a variable.

   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `case Constants.IOGP` is a new feature that provides a citation for IOGP. It is a valid and useful addition, especially if the system supports multiple citation types.
     - This change is additive and does not interfere with the existing logic unless the structure is changed.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to refactor the switch-case into a more flexible if-else structure, likely to allow for more dynamic or complex condition checks.

   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to expand the system's capabilities by supporting a new citation type (IOGP), which is a logical and necessary addition for completeness.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The structural change in `a` (switch-case to if-else) is significant and would invalidate the existing `case Constants.EPSG` and the new `case Constants.IOGP` added in `b`.
   - However, the addition in `b` is a valid and necessary feature. Therefore, the best approach is to **keep the addition from `b`** and **adapt the logic from `a`** to work with the new structure.
   - The `if-else` logic from `a` can be extended to include the new case from `b` by checking for `Constants.IOGP` and `Constants.EPSG` in the same conditional block.

   - The final resolution should preserve the new IOGP case and integrate the conditional logic from `a` in a way that supports both cases.
