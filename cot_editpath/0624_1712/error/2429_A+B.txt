### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* @since   0.3
 * @version 0.8
||||||| base
* @since   0.3
 * @version 0.3
=======
* @version 0.3
 * @since   0.3
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> 3 <WITH> 8)


## From base to b
<ADD> * @ version 0 . 3 <newline>
<DELETE> <newline> * @ version 0 . 3


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

# CoT

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, both `@since` and `@version` are set to `0.3`.
   - In branch `a`, the `@version` is updated from `0.3` to `0.8`, while `@since` remains `0.3`.
   - In branch `b`, the `@version` is deleted and then re-added, but the order of `@since` and `@version` is swapped. The content remains the same (`0.3` for both).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Updating `@version` to `0.8` indicates that the feature or code has evolved beyond the base version. This is a meaningful change that reflects progress in the codebase.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The `@version` is deleted and re-added, which seems to be a formatting or reordering change. The content is unchanged, but the order of the tags is swapped. This might be for consistency in documentation style.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To reflect the updated version of the code or feature.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To reformat or reorder the Javadoc tags for consistency or readability, without changing the semantic meaning.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most important change is the version update in branch `a`, as it reflects the actual progress of the code.
   - The reordering in branch `b` is a stylistic change and can be applied on top of the version update.
   - Therefore, the resolution should keep the updated version from `a` and apply the reordered format from `b`.

/**
 * @since   0.3
 * @version 0.8
 */
```
