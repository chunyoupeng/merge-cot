### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - No visible changes in the code snippet provided. It appears that `a` may not have modified the code in this section compared to the base.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduced a new check for `serverConfig == null` and throws an exception if it is null.
     - Changed the type of `clientConfig` from `ClientDetails` to `RegisteredClient`.
     - Added a check for `clientConfig == null` and throws an exception if it is null.
     - Introduced logic to determine `redirectUri` based on `clientConfig.getRegisteredRedirectUri()`. If it exists and has exactly one entry, it uses that; otherwise, it defaults to the current URL.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - No changes were made in the provided code, so there is no new logic to evaluate.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The `serverConfig` null check is a defensive programming practice that ensures the configuration is valid before proceeding.
     - The change from `ClientDetails` to `RegisteredClient` suggests a refactoring or API change in the system.
     - The `clientConfig` null check is also a defensive programming practice.
     - The logic for determining `redirectUri` is more robust and flexible than the base version, which simply used the current URL.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - No changes were made, so there is no intention to infer.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention appears to be to make the code more robust by adding null checks and improving the logic for determining the redirect URI.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` has no changes, the resolution should incorporate the changes from branch `b`.
   - The changes in branch `b` improve the robustness and correctness of the code.
   - The code should use the `RegisteredClient` type and include the null checks for both `serverConfig` and `clientConfig`.
   - The logic for determining the `redirectUri` should be based on the presence and size of the `RegisteredRedirect
