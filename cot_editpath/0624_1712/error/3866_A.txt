### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager <WITH> final)
<REPLACE> . <WITH> String)
<REPLACE> showError <WITH> errorCode)
<REPLACE> ( <WITH> =)
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> ) <newline> if ( ! bySocket ) {
<REPLACE> <newline> <WITH> errorCode)
<DELETE> ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager . ERROR_NULL_URI <newline> <newline> } <newline> return ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager . getErrorMessage ( <newline> ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager . ERROR_NULL_URI <newline> ) ;


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> <newline> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaces the call to `showError(...)` with a direct assignment of `errorCode` to a `final String`.
     - Removes the `if (!bySocket)` block and the `return` statement.
     - The result is a simplified version that only throws an exception with the error code.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Keeps the `showError(...)` call.
     - Keeps the `if (!bySocket)` block and the `return` statement.
     - The result is a version that shows the error, conditionally throws an exception, and returns the error message.
   - The conflict is in the logic flow and the handling of the error: `a` simplifies it to only throw an exception, while `b` retains the original behavior of showing the error and conditionally throwing.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change to assign `errorCode` and throw an exception is simpler and more direct.
     - However, it removes the conditional logic and the return statement, which may be important for other parts of the system expecting an error message.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Retains the original behavior, which includes showing the error and returning the message.
     - This is more flexible and preserves backward compatibility with code that may rely on the returned message or the conditional throw.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to simplify the error handling by removing unnecessary steps and focusing on throwing the exception.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to preserve the original behavior for compatibility and completeness.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best resolution is to **combine the best of both branches**.
   - Keep the `showError(...)` call from `b` to ensure the error is shown.
   - Keep the `if (!bySocket)` block from `b` to preserve the conditional logic.
   - Keep the `return` statement from `b` to ensure the error message is returned.
   - Use the `errorCode` assignment from `a` to make the code cleaner and more readable.
   - This way, we preserve the original behavior while making the code more concise and readable.

```java
final String errorCode = ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager.ERROR_NULL_URI;
ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager.showError(errorCode);
if (!bySocket) {
    throw new SocketOperationException(errorCode);
}
return ProtocolInvocationLauncherErrorManager.getErrorMessage(errorCode);
```
