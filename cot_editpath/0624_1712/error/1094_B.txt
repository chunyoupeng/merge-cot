### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different implementations of a method comment.
   - **Branch `a`** provides a Javadoc comment that describes a method for creating local-side port forwarding, with a reference to another method (`#setPortForwardingL`).
   - **Branch `b`** provides a more detailed Javadoc comment that includes parameters, return values, and a reference to a more complex method variant.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** focuses on the high-level purpose of the method and is concise.
   - **Branch `b`** is more detailed and includes parameter descriptions, return values, and a reference to a more flexible method variant.
   - Both changes are valid but serve different documentation purposes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to clarify the method's purpose and usage in a high-level way.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to provide comprehensive documentation for developers using the method, including API details.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches aim to improve documentation, the best resolution is to **combine the strengths of both**.
   - The final Javadoc should include the high-level description from `a`, the detailed parameter and return information from `b`, and the appropriate `@see` references from both.
