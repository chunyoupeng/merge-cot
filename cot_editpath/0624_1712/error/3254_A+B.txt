### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* @param customUrl                      Custom URL to sen to gerrit instead of build URL
     * @param serverName                     The selected server
||||||| base
* @param customUrl                      Custom URL to sen to gerrit instead of build URL
=======
* @param customUrl                      Custom URL to send to Gerrit instead of build URL
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> * @ param serverName The selected server


## From base to b
<REPLACE> sen <WITH> send)
<REPLACE> gerrit <WITH> Gerrit)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the line is:
     ```
     * @param customUrl                      Custom URL to sen to gerrit instead of build URL
     ```
   - In branch `a`, a new parameter `serverName` is added:
     ```
     * @param serverName                     The selected server
     ```
   - In branch `b`, two corrections are made:
     - "sen" is corrected to "send"
     - "gerrit" is capitalized to "Gerrit"

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding the `serverName` parameter is a meaningful addition that introduces a new parameter with a clear description. This change should be preserved as it adds functionality.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes:** The corrections "sen" → "send" and "gerrit" → "Gerrit" are spelling and capitalization fixes. These are important for clarity and consistency in documentation and should also be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To introduce a new parameter `serverName` for specifying the selected server.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To correct a typo and ensure proper capitalization for the system name "Gerrit".

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `serverName` parameter from branch `a` should be included.
   - The corrections from branch `b` should be applied to the base line.
   - The result will be a clean, corrected line with the new parameter added below it.

```java
* @param customUrl                      Custom URL to send to Gerrit instead of build URL
* @param serverName                     The selected server
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
* @param customUrl                      Custom URL to sen to Gerrit instead of build URL
     * @param serverName                     The selected server
