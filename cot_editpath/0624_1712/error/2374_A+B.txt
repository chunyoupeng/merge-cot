### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the definition of a set of constants and a `Set<String>` called `SORT_FIELDS`.
   - In branch `a`, the following constants are defined:
     - `START_DATE`
     - `SCHEDULE_DATE`
     - `PARAMETERS`
     - `SORT_FIELDS` includes `START_DATE` and `SCHEDULE_DATE`.
   - In branch `b`, the constant `DESCRIPTION` is defined, but there is no mention of `START_DATE` or `SCHEDULE_DATE` in the `SORT_FIELDS` set.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` introduces two new date-related constants and adds them to the `SORT_FIELDS` set. This suggests an intention to support sorting by these date fields.
   - Branch `b` introduces a `DESCRIPTION` constant but does not add it to the `SORT_FIELDS` set. This suggests an intention to define a new field but not to sort by it.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to enhance sorting capabilities by including new date fields.
   - The intention in `b` is to define a new field (`DESCRIPTION`) but not to use it for sorting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `DESCRIPTION` constant from branch `b` should be added to the list of constants.
   - The `START_DATE` and `SCHEDULE_DATE` constants from branch `a` should also be retained.
   - The `SORT_FIELDS` set should include all constants that are intended for sorting. Since `DESCRIPTION` is not included in `SORT_FIELDS` in branch `b`, it should not be added to the set unless sorting by it is intended.
   - Therefore, the final `SORT_FIELDS` set should include all the constants from `a` and exclude `DESCRIPTION` unless sorting by it is required.
