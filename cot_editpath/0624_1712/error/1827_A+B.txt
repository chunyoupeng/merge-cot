### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
T evaluate(PebbleTemplateImpl self, EvaluationContextImpl context) throws PebbleException;
||||||| base
T evaluate(PebbleTemplateImpl self, EvaluationContext context) throws PebbleException;
=======
T evaluate(PebbleTemplateImpl self, EvaluationContext context);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> EvaluationContext <WITH> EvaluationContextImpl)


## From base to b
<DELETE> throws PebbleException


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method signature is:
     ```java
     T evaluate(PebbleTemplateImpl self, EvaluationContext context) throws PebbleException;
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the change is:
     ```java
     T evaluate(PebbleTemplateImpl self, EvaluationContextImpl context) throws PebbleException;
     ```
     This replaces `EvaluationContext` with `EvaluationContextImpl`, suggesting that `a` is trying to use a concrete implementation instead of the interface.
   - In branch `b`, the change is:
     ```java
     T evaluate(PebbleTemplateImpl self, EvaluationContext context);
     ```
     This removes the `throws PebbleException` clause, indicating that `b` is trying to remove the exception from the method signature, possibly because it no longer throws it or is handling it internally.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Replacing `EvaluationContext` with `EvaluationContextImpl` is a design choice. It might be intended to use a specific implementation for performance or behavior reasons. However, using an interface (`EvaluationContext`) is generally preferred for flexibility and decoupling.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Removing `throws PebbleException` is a significant change. If the method no longer throws this exception, it's valid. However, if it still can throw it, removing it could lead to runtime errors or unchecked exceptions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to use a concrete implementation of the context, possibly for tighter control or optimization.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to simplify the method signature by removing the exception, likely because it is no longer thrown or is now handled internally.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The use of `EvaluationContext` (interface) is generally preferred over `EvaluationContextImpl` (implementation) for better abstraction and flexibility.
   - Removing `throws PebbleException` is risky unless the method is confirmed to no longer throw it. If the exception is still relevant, it should remain.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the interface (`EvaluationContext`) and retain the exception clause (`throws PebbleException`) to maintain correctness and compatibility.
