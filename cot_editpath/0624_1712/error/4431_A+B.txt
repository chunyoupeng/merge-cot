### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have completely different code from the base (which is empty).
   - Branch `a` introduces two new methods: `getTapSymbol()` and `getWhiteSymbol()`. These methods retrieve a resource identifier for drawables based on preferences.
   - Branch `b` introduces two new methods: `getUndoTimeout()` and `getShowTotalDecklistPrice()`. These methods retrieve preference values related to UI behavior and timeouts.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of methods are valid and serve different purposes:
     - `a`'s methods are related to retrieving symbol drawables based on user preferences.
     - `b`'s methods are related to retrieving timeout and visibility settings for UI features.
   - There is no overlap in functionality or naming between the two sets of methods.
   - Both sets of methods are logically distinct and serve different parts of the application.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a way to dynamically retrieve symbol drawables based on user preferences.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide access to timeout and visibility settings for UI features like undo and total price display.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of methods are unrelated and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of changes** into a single class.
   - This maintains the functionality of both branches and avoids any loss of features.
   - The code should be structured in a way that logically groups related methods, but since both sets are unrelated, they can simply be placed together.
