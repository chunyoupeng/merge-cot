### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

protected final HashSet<String> parsedAttrs;

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> protected private private


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> final HashSet < String > booleanAttrs ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the variables `parsedAttrs`, `uriAttrs`, and `inlineURIAttrs` are declared as `final HashSet<String>`.
   - In branch `a`, the access modifier `protected` is added to these variables, and there is an extra `private` keyword (likely a typo or error).
   - In branch `b`, a new variable `booleanAttrs` is added with the same `final HashSet<String>` type.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `protected` increases the visibility of the variables, which might be intended for subclass access. However, the extra `private` keyword is likely a mistake and should be removed.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding a new `booleanAttrs` variable is a clean and straightforward addition that does not conflict with the existing code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To make the variables accessible to subclasses by changing their access modifier to `protected`.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To add a new set of attributes (`booleanAttrs`) for handling boolean attributes, likely for some new functionality or categorization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `protected` access modifier from branch `a` should be kept, but the redundant `private` keyword should be removed.
   - The new `booleanAttrs` variable from branch `b` should be added to the class.
   - The final result should reflect both changes in a clean and correct manner.
