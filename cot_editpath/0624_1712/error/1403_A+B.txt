### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline> * Method that subclasses may call for standard handling of an exception thrown when <newline> * calling constructor or factory method . Will unwrap { @ link ExceptionInInitializerError } <newline> * and { @ link InvocationTargetException } s , then call { @ link # wrapAsJsonMappingException } . <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base version contains a Javadoc comment with a `@since 2.7` tag.
   - Branch `a` completely removes all content from the base.
   - Branch `b` adds a detailed Javadoc comment describing the method's purpose and behavior, including the `@since 2.7` tag.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** removes all content, which is essentially discarding the Javadoc comment. This could be intentional (e.g., if the method is being removed or renamed), but it's not clear from the context.
   - **Branch `b`** adds a comprehensive Javadoc comment, which is a valuable addition for documentation and clarity. It explains the method's purpose, behavior, and includes relevant Javadoc links.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to remove the method or its documentation entirely.
   - **Branch `b`** clearly intends to improve the documentation of the method, making it more informative and helpful for developers.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `b` provides a clear and useful enhancement to the documentation, and there is no indication that the method should be removed (as implied by branch `a`), the best resolution is to keep the detailed Javadoc comment from branch `b`.
   - The `@since 2.7` tag is retained as it is consistent with both the base and branch `b`.
