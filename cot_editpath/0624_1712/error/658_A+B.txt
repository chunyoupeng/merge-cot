### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> . build ( ) <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the structure is:
     ```java
     .defaultsForCommand(command)
         .proxyFactory(proxyFactory)
         .progressListener(new StandardConsoleProgressListener())
     )
     )
     .build());
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the changes are:
     - Removed two newlines (likely for formatting).
     - Closed the method call with `)))` and `build()` is still in place.
   - In branch `b`, the changes are:
     - Added `.build()` after `StandardConsoleProgressListener()`.
     - Added a newline and extra parentheses, which may be due to formatting or restructuring the method chaining.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The removal of newlines is a formatting change and does not affect functionality.
     - The closing of the method call with `)))` is consistent with the base structure.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `.build()` after `StandardConsoleProgressListener()` is a functional change. It suggests that the `progressListener` method might return a builder object that needs to be built.
     - The extra parentheses and newline are likely formatting changes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to clean up formatting and ensure the method call is correctly closed.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to add a `.build()` call to finalize the configuration, possibly because the `progressListener` method now returns a builder instead of the configured object.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The key functional change is the addition of `.build()` in branch `b`. This suggests that the `progressListener` method now returns a builder, and the configuration must be finalized with `.build()`.
   - The formatting changes in both branches are minor and can be standardized.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to include the `.build()` call from branch `b` and clean up the formatting to match a consistent style.

                .build()
        .build();
