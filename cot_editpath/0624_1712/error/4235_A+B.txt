### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import de.adorsys.psd2.consent.server.service.security.DecryptedData;
import de.adorsys.psd2.consent.server.service.security.SecurityDataService;
||||||| base

=======
import de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.core.consent.ConsentStatus;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - `a` added the following imports:
     ```java
     import de.adorsys.psd2.consent.server.service.security.DecryptedData;
     import de.adorsys.psd2.consent.server.service.security.SecurityDataService;
     ```
   - `b` added the following import:
     ```java
     import de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.core.consent.ConsentStatus;
     ```
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own imports.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s imports are related to security data handling (e.g., decryption and security data service), which suggests the code in `a` is working with sensitive data and requires decryption capabilities.
   - `b`'s import is related to consent status, which is a core concept in the PSD2/XS2A framework, indicating the code in `b` is likely dealing with consent management and status tracking.
   - Both sets of imports are relevant and serve different purposes. There is no overlap or conflict in the imported classes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to support secure data handling, likely for decrypting and processing sensitive consent data.
   - The intention of `b` is to support consent status management, which is a core part of the XS2A framework.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of imports are distinct and serve different purposes, there is no conflict in functionality or logic.
   - The correct resolution is to merge both sets of imports into a single list at the top of the file.
   - This ensures that both features (security data handling and consent status management) are supported in the merged code.
