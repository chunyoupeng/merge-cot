### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

        } else throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported data type ["+datatype+"] for field: " + key);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> } else if ( datatype . equals ( UUID . class ) ) { <newline> postfix = " _uuid " ; <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> } else if ( datatype . equals ( Date . class ) ) { <newline> postfix = " _dt " ; <newline> } else if ( datatype . equals ( Boolean . class ) ) { <newline> postfix = " _b " ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, there is a single `else` block that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the `datatype` is not supported.
   - In branch `a`, a new `else if` condition is added to handle `UUID.class`, assigning the postfix `"_uuid"` and keeping the `else` block for unsupported types.
   - In branch `b`, two new `else if` conditions are added: one for `Date.class` assigning `"_dt"` and another for `Boolean.class` assigning `"_b"`, followed by the same `else` block as in the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** adds support for `UUID` by appending `"_uuid"` to the field name. This is a valid and useful addition.
   - **Branch `b`** adds support for `Date` and `Boolean` types, which are also valid and useful additions.
   - The `else` block in both branches correctly throws an exception for unsupported types.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both branches is to extend the list of supported data types and assign appropriate postfixes to the field names.
   - The changes are additive and do not conflict in logic, but they both modify the same part of the code, leading to a merge conflict.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The correct resolution is to **combine the changes from both branches**.
   - The order of the `else if` conditions should be preserved as in branch `b` (Date and Boolean), and the new `UUID` condition from branch `a` should be added at the end.
   - This ensures all three data types are supported with their respective postfixes, and the `else` block remains for unsupported types.
   - The code style and logic are consistent, and the resolution maintains correctness and clarity.

    postfix = "_uuid";

    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported data type [" + datatype + "] for field: " + key);
