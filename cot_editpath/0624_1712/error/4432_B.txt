### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> *
<DELETE> <newline> *
<ADD> <newline> * / <newline> / * * <newline> *


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# CoT
<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the comment describing the behavior of workers after a query plan finishes.
   - **Branch a** has no changes compared to base in this section.
   - **Branch b** adds a new line with `* /` and removes a newline with `*`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** has no changes, so it preserves the original comment structure.
   - **Branch b** introduces an incomplete or malformed line (`* /`) and removes a newline, which could be an error or incomplete edit.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely intends to keep the original comment unchanged.
   - **Branch b** may have been attempting to add a new comment line or modify the comment structure, but the edit is incomplete or malformed.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since **branch a** has no changes and **branch b** has an incomplete or malformed edit, the correct resolution is to keep the original comment from **branch a** (or base).
   - The edit in **branch b** appears to be an error or incomplete and should be discarded.
