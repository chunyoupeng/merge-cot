### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different code blocks. Branch `a` introduces three new methods:
     - `selectedColumnHash(String query)`: Extracts and hashes selected columns from an SQL query.
     - `readFile(String path, Charset encoding)`: Reads a file into a string.
     - `getFreePortNumber()`: Finds a free port number.
   - Branch `b` introduces a method `parseTemplate(String template)` that parses a template string into a `Template` object, handling variables and constants.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - `selectedColumnHash` is a utility method for SQL query analysis.
     - `readFile` is a standard file-reading utility.
     - `getFreePortNumber` is a common utility for finding a free port.
     - These methods are likely part of a broader system that deals with SQL queries, file I/O, and network operations.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - `parseTemplate` is a method for parsing a template string into a structured format, likely for templating or data formatting purposes.
     - This method is likely part of a system that uses templates for generating output or processing data.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is focused on SQL query parsing, file reading, and port allocation. These are likely part of a system that processes SQL queries and handles I/O operations.
   - **Branch `b`** is focused on template parsing, which is likely part of a system that generates output from templates, possibly for reporting, data formatting, or message generation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two branches are adding completely different functionalities to the codebase.
   - There is no overlap in the functionality or the code structure.
   - Since both sets of methods are likely needed for different parts of the system, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes.
   - No code from either branch needs to be discarded or modified.
   - The final code should include all the methods from both branches.
