### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , 0 , 0


## From base to b
<ADD> String proxyUsername , String proxyPassword , <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> proxyUsername , proxyPassword ,


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added two integer parameters (`0, 0`) at the end of the constructor call in the line:
     ```java
     this(factory, host, port, proxy, reconnectPolicy, delegate, false, ApnsConnection.DEFAULT_CACHE_LENGTH, true, 0, 0);
     ```
   - **Branch `b`** added two new `String` parameters (`proxyUsername`, `proxyPassword`) to the method signature and passed them in the constructor call:
     ```java
     this(factory, host, port, proxy, proxyUsername, proxyPassword, reconnectPolicy, delegate, false, ApnsConnection.DEFAULT_CACHE_LENGTH, true);
     ```

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be adding two placeholder integer values (`0, 0`) at the end of the constructor call. This suggests that the constructor being called in `a` has been modified to accept two additional integer parameters. However, the method signature in `a` does not reflect these new parameters, which could be a sign of an incomplete or incorrect change.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces two new `String` parameters (`proxyUsername`, `proxyPassword`) to support proxy authentication. This is a more substantial and meaningful change, likely intended to allow the connection to use a proxy with authentication credentials.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** appears to be adding two integer parameters to the constructor call, possibly for future configuration or placeholder purposes. However, the method signature does not reflect these changes, which may indicate a mistake or an incomplete implementation.
   - **Branch `b`** is clearly adding proxy authentication support by introducing `proxyUsername` and `proxyPassword` parameters. This is a logical and necessary change for supporting authenticated proxy connections.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in **branch `b`** is more meaningful and aligns with a clear use case (supporting proxy authentication).
   - The change in **branch `a`** appears to be incomplete or incorrect, as the method signature does not reflect the added parameters in the constructor call.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the changes from **branch `b`** and discard the incomplete changes from **branch `a`**.

# Final Resolution

```java
int port, Proxy proxy, String proxyUsername, String proxyPassword,
        ReconnectPolicy reconnectPolicy, ApnsDelegate delegate) {
    this(factory, host, port, proxy, proxyUsername, proxyPassword, reconnectPolicy,
            delegate, false, ApnsConnection.DEFAULT_CACHE_LENGTH, true);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
int port, Proxy proxy, String proxyUsername, String proxyPassword,
            ReconnectPolicy reconnectPolicy, ApnsDelegate delegate) {
        this(factory, host, port, proxy, proxyUsername, proxyPassword, reconnectPolicy,
                delegate, false, ApnsConnection.DEFAULT_CACHE_LENGTH, true, 0, 0);
