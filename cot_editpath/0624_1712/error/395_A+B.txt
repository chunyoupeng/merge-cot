### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
*
     * @since 2.10
=======
*
     * @return Exception message for indicating "missing padding" case
     *
     * @since 2.10
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline> * @ return Exception message for indicating " missing padding " case <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code contains a Javadoc comment with a `@since 2.10` tag.
   - Branch `a` has removed all content from the base.
   - Branch `b` has added a new Javadoc line: `* @return Exception message for indicating "missing padding" case`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** completely removes the content, which could be problematic if the Javadoc is necessary for understanding the method's purpose or behavior.
   - **Branch `b`** adds a meaningful `@return` description, which improves documentation and clarity for developers.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** might be attempting to reset or remove outdated documentation, but this is overly aggressive and could lead to loss of important information.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to enhance the documentation by adding a clear description of the return value, which is a common and useful practice in Javadoc.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of branch `b` is more constructive and aligns with good documentation practices.
   - Branch `a`'s removal of all content is too destructive and does not preserve the necessary context.
   - Therefore, the resolution should retain the added `@return` description from branch `b` and discard the complete removal from branch `a`.
