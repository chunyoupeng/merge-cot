### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
public static ShadowPagerAdapter shadowOf(PagerAdapter instance) {
        return (ShadowPagerAdapter) shadowOf_(instance);
    }
=======
public static ShadowObjectAnimator shadowOf(ObjectAnimator instance) {
        return (ShadowObjectAnimator) shadowOf_(instance);
    }

    public static ShadowPagerAdapter shadowOf(PagerAdapter instance) {
        return (ShadowPagerAdapter) shadowOf_(instance);
    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> public static ShadowObjectAnimator shadowOf ( ObjectAnimator instance ) { <newline> return ( ShadowObjectAnimator ) shadowOf_ ( instance ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code contains a single method: `public static ShadowPagerAdapter shadowOf(PagerAdapter instance)`.
   - **Branch a** has removed all content from the base, meaning the `shadowOf` method for `PagerAdapter` is deleted.
   - **Branch b** has added a new method: `public static ShadowObjectAnimator shadowOf(ObjectAnimator instance)` and retained the original `shadowOf` method for `PagerAdapter`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** removes the `shadowOf` method for `PagerAdapter`. This could indicate that the method is no longer needed or is being replaced elsewhere.
   - **Branch b** adds a new method for `ObjectAnimator`, which is a separate class. This suggests an expansion of the `shadowOf` utility to support more types. It also retains the original method, which implies that the `PagerAdapter` version is still considered necessary.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely aims to remove or refactor the `PagerAdapter` shadow method, possibly due to deprecation or replacement.
   - **Branch b** aims to extend the functionality of the `shadowOf` utility to support `ObjectAnimator`, which is a logical and non-conflicting addition.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since **branch b** adds a new method without removing the existing one, and **branch a** removes the existing method entirely, the most logical resolution is to **keep the new method from branch b** and **discard the deletion from branch a**.
   - This preserves the extended functionality while maintaining backward compatibility with `PagerAdapter`.

```java
public static ShadowObjectAnimator shadowOf(ObjectAnimator instance) {
    return (ShadowObjectAnimator) shadowOf_(instance);
}

public static ShadowPagerAdapter shadowOf(PagerAdapter instance) {
    return (ShadowPagerAdapter) shadowOf_(instance);
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public static ShadowObjectAnimator shadowOf(ObjectAnimator instance) {
        return (ShadowObjectAnimator) shadowOf_(instance);
    }
