### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> asciidoctor ( ) asciidoctor ( ) ,


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added `asciidoctor()` to the `snippet()` call and also added `asciidoctor()` as an argument to `httpResponse(...)`. This suggests an intention to associate the HTTP response with the `asciidoctor` functionality.
   - **Branch `b`** removed some newlines and added a newline, likely to reformat the code for readability or to fix formatting inconsistencies. It does not introduce any functional change.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in **`a`** introduces a functional modification by adding `asciidoctor()` to both the `snippet()` and `httpResponse()` calls. This likely reflects an intention to enhance the test or example with specific context related to `asciidoctor`.
   - The change in **`b`** is purely cosmetic (formatting), and does not affect the logic or behavior of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **`a`** aims to enrich the test or example by explicitly associating it with `asciidoctor`, which could be important for clarity or correctness in the context of the test suite.
   - **`b`** aims to improve code formatting, which is a valid concern but does not conflict with the functional change in `a`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the change in `b` is purely cosmetic and does not interfere with the functional change in `a`, we can safely incorporate both changes.
   - The formatting from `b` can be applied to the updated code from `a` to maintain consistent style.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the functional enhancement from `a` and apply the formatting from `b`.

```java
is(snippet(asciidoctor()).withContents(
		httpResponse(asciidoctor(), HttpStatus.OK)
				.header("a", "alpha")
				.header("Content-Type", "application/json")
				.header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_LENGTH, original.getBytes().length)
				.content(original)));
```
