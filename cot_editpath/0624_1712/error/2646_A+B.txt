### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public void setScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName, String propVal);
  
  public String getScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName);
  // public String getProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName, String defaultVal);
||||||| base

=======
public ScriptParam getParamByName(String pName);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, so both branches `a` and `b` have added entirely new code.
   - Branch `a` added two methods:
     - `public void setScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName, String propVal);`
     - `public String getScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName);`
   - Branch `b` added one method:
     - `public ScriptParam getParamByName(String pName);`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - All three methods appear to be related to retrieving or setting properties or parameters, but they differ in their implementation and purpose:
     - `setScriptProperty` and `getScriptProperty` from `a` are likely for setting and retrieving script properties with a `ScriptRunner` context.
     - `getParamByName` from `b` is for retrieving a `ScriptParam` object by name, which may be a more general or object-oriented approach.
   - Since the base is empty, there is no overlap in the code added by `a` and `b`, so the conflict is not about overwriting but about combining new additions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - `a` seems to be focused on managing script properties via a `ScriptRunner` context.
   - `b` is focused on retrieving a `ScriptParam` object by name, which may be part of a different abstraction or API.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the methods are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to include all three methods in the final code.
   - No method needs to be discarded or modified, as they are not conflicting in the same code region.
   - The resolution should preserve the functionality and intent of both branches.

```java
public void setScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName, String propVal);

public String getScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName);

public ScriptParam getParamByName(String pName);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public ScriptParam getParamByName(String pName);
  
  public void setScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName, String propVal);
  
  public String getScriptProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName);
  // public String getProperty(ScriptRunner runner, String propName, String defaultVal);
