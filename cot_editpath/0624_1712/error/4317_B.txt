### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
*
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
	 * @param element Webelement to be scrolled to
>>>>>>> a3f7d27... DAR-289: Added and changed selenium tests for DAR-136
||||||| base

=======

	 * @param element Webelement to be scrolled to
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> < < < < < < < HEAD <newline> = = = = = = = <newline> * @ param element Webelement to be scrolled to <newline> > > > > > > > a3f7d27 . . . DAR - 289 : Added and changed selenium tests for DAR - 136


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> * @ param element Webelement to be scrolled to


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code has a line: `*`
   - In branch `a`, the line is replaced with:
     ```
     * @param element Webelement to be scrolled to
     ```
     This is part of a merge conflict marker from a previous merge.
   - In branch `b`, the line is also replaced with:
     ```
     * @param element Webelement to be scrolled to
     ```
     This is a clean addition of a Javadoc parameter description.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` appears to have a merge conflict marker (`>>>>>>> a`, `<<<<<<< HEAD`, etc.) which suggests it is part of a failed or unresolved merge. The content itself (`* @param element Webelement to be scrolled to`) is valid and meaningful.
   - Branch `b` cleanly adds the same Javadoc parameter description without any merge conflict markers. This is a straightforward and clean change.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both branches is to add a Javadoc parameter description for clarity and documentation.
   - The branch `a` change is likely part of a larger merge that introduced conflict markers, which should be resolved.
   - The branch `b` change is a clean, direct addition with no conflict markers.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The clean addition from branch `b` should be used.
   - The merge conflict markers in branch `a` should be removed.
   - The content (`* @param element Webelement to be scrolled to`) is valid and should be retained.
