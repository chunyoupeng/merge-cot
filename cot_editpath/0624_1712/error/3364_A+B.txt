### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> * < div class = " warning " > < b > Warning : < / b > in a future SIS version , the return type may be changed <newline> * to { @ code org . opengis . referencing . cs . ParametricCS } . This change is pending GeoAPI revision . < / div > <newline> * <newline>


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Name <WITH> name)
<REPLACE> The <WITH> the)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a warning comment block about a future change in return type to `ParametricCS`, which is pending GeoAPI revision. This is a documentation change to inform users about a potential future API change.
   - **Branch `b`** made two minor stylistic changes:
     - Changed "Name" to "name" (lowercase).
     - Changed "The" to "the" (lowercase).
     These are likely to align with a code style guideline that prefers lowercase for parameter descriptions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is significant and informative. It adds a warning that is useful for developers and users to be aware of a future API change. This is a documentation improvement that serves a clear purpose.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is minor and stylistic. It improves consistency in the parameter descriptions by using lowercase, which is a common style in Java Javadoc.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve clarity and communication about future API changes.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to improve code style and consistency in Javadoc formatting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The warning from `a` is important for future compatibility and should be retained.
   - The stylistic changes from `b` (lowercasing "Name" and "The") are also valid and should be applied to the warning message to maintain consistent Javadoc style.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both the warning message and the stylistic improvements.

# Final Resolution

```java
/**
 * <div class="warning"><b>Warning:</b> in a future SIS version, the return type may be changed
 * to {@code org.opengis.referencing.cs.ParametricCS}. This change is pending GeoAPI revision.</div>
 *

 * @param  axis        the single axis.

     * @param  properties  name and other properties to give to the new object.
     * @param  axis        the single axis.
