### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> TAG <WITH> [)
<ADD> ] TAGS { <newline> " < vk group - id = \ " 59925174 \ " / > " , , <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> private static final String INCORRECT_TAG = " < vk / > " ; <newline> private static final String ERROR_MESSAGE = " Failed to render the VK widget . Please check if all required parameters are in place . " ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the `TAG` constant with an array `TAGS` containing two strings.
     - The new array includes the original tag (`<vk group-id="12345" />`) and a new one (`<vk group-id="59925174" />`).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added two new constants: `INCORRECT_TAG` and `ERROR_MESSAGE`.
     - These are likely used for validation or error handling in the code.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - The change introduces an array of tags, which suggests the code may now need to handle multiple VK group tags.
     - This is a structural change that affects how the code uses the `TAG` constant.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The addition of `INCORRECT_TAG` and `ERROR_MESSAGE` is likely for validation or error reporting.
     - These are non-conflicting additions that enhance the robustness of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to support multiple VK group tags, possibly for different environments or use cases.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to improve error handling and validation by defining an incorrect tag format and an error message.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes from both branches are complementary and non-conflicting.
   - The array `TAGS` from `a` should be retained to support multiple tags.
   - The constants `INCORRECT_TAG` and `ERROR_MESSAGE` from `b` should also be retained to improve validation and error handling.
   - The final code should combine both changes into a coherent and well-structured format.

# Final Resolution

```java
private static final String[] TAGS = {
      "<vk group-id=\"12345\" />",
      "<vk group-id=\"59925174\" />",
  };
  private static final String INCORRECT_TAG = "<vk />";
  private static final String ERROR_MESSAGE = "Failed to render the VK widget. Please check if all required parameters are in place.";
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
private static final String[] TAGS = {
      "<vk group-id=\"59925174\" />",
      "<vk group-id=\"12345\" />",
  };
  private static final String INCORRECT_TAG = "<vk />";
  private static final String ERROR_MESSAGE = "Failed to render the VK widget. Please check if all required parameters are in place.";
