### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> / / Config config = Config . build ( ) . withEncryptionLevel ( encryptionLevel ) . toConfig ( ) ; <newline> <newline> Neo4jRunner .
<REPLACE> <newline> <WITH> DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN)
<DELETE> AuthTokens . basic ( TestNeo4j . USER , TestNeo4j . PASSWORD )
<ADD> . toConfig ( )


## From base to b
<DELETE> Neo4jRunner .
<REPLACE> <newline> <WITH> DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN)
<DELETE> AuthTokens . basic ( TestNeo4j . USER , TestNeo4j . PASSWORD )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the `Config` creation line (`Config config = Config.build().withEncryptionLevel(...)`) and replaced it with `.toConfig()` on an existing config object.
     - Replaced `Neo4jRunner.DEFAULT_URI` with `DEFAULT_URI`.
     - Replaced `AuthTokens.basic(...)` with `DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Removed `Neo4jRunner.` from `Neo4jRunner.DEFAULT_URI`, resulting in `DEFAULT_URI`.
     - Replaced `AuthTokens.basic(...)` with `DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN`.
   - The conflict arises in the `GraphDatabase.driver(...)` line, where both `a` and `b` are trying to simplify the authentication and URI usage, but `a` also modifies the `Config` handling.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The removal of the `Config` creation line and use of `.toConfig()` suggests that the config is already built elsewhere, which is a valid simplification if the config is pre-built.
     - Replacing `AuthTokens.basic(...)` with `DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN` is a good move if `DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN` is a shared constant.
     - Replacing `Neo4jRunner.DEFAULT_URI` with `DEFAULT_URI` is also a simplification if the constant is already defined at the top level.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The changes are similar to `a` in terms of replacing `Neo4jRunner.DEFAULT_URI` and `AuthTokens.basic(...)`, but it does not touch the `Config` creation line.
     - This suggests that `b` is only simplifying the URI and authentication, not the config handling.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely trying to streamline the code by removing redundant config creation and using a pre-built config object.
   - **Branch `b`** is simplifying the URI and authentication usage but is not changing the config handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most logical resolution is to keep the simplified URI and authentication from both `a` and `b`, and also adopt the config simplification from `a`.
   - This results in a cleaner and more consistent code block that uses pre-defined constants and avoids redundant config creation.

```java
// Given config with sessionLivenessCheckTimeout not set, i.e. turned off
Config config = Config.build().withEncryptionLevel( encryptionLevel ).toConfig();

try ( Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver( DEFAULT_URI, DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN, config ) )
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
// Given config with sessionLivenessCheckTimeout not set, i.e. turned off
        try ( Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver( DEFAULT_URI, DEFAULT_AUTH_TOKEN, config.toConfig() ) )
