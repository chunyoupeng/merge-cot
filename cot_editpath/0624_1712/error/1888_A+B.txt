### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

InstructorResultsParticipantPanel giverPanel) {
        List<InstructorResultsParticipantPanel> teamsMembersPanels;
||||||| base
InstructorFeedbackResultsGroupByQuestionPanel giverPanel) {
        List<InstructorResultsParticipantPanel> teamsMembersPanels;
=======
InstructorFeedbackResultsGroupByQuestionPanel giverPanel) {
        List<InstructorFeedbackResultsParticipantPanel> teamsMembersPanels;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> InstructorFeedbackResultsGroupByQuestionPanel <WITH> InstructorResultsParticipantPanel)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> InstructorResultsParticipantPanel <WITH> InstructorFeedbackResultsParticipantPanel)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method parameter is `InstructorFeedbackResultsGroupByQuestionPanel giverPanel`, and the list is of type `InstructorResultsParticipantPanel`.
   - In branch `a`, the parameter type is changed from `InstructorFeedbackResultsGroupByQuestionPanel` to `InstructorResultsParticipantPanel`.
   - In branch `b`, the list type is changed from `InstructorResultsParticipantPanel` to `InstructorFeedbackResultsParticipantPanel`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change:** Changing the parameter type from `InstructorFeedbackResultsGroupByQuestionPanel` to `InstructorResultsParticipantPanel` suggests that the method is now intended to work with a different kind of panel, likely one that represents individual participants rather than grouped feedback.
   - **Branch `b` change:** Changing the list type from `InstructorResultsParticipantPanel` to `InstructorFeedbackResultsParticipantPanel` suggests that the method is now intended to work with a more specific type of participant panel that includes feedback data.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** The method is being adapted to work with individual participant panels instead of grouped feedback panels.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** The method is being adapted to work with a more specific type of participant panel that includes feedback data.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in both branches are related to adapting the method to work with different types of panels. However, the types used in each branch are incompatible with each other.
   - The correct resolution is to use the more specific type introduced in branch `b` (`InstructorFeedbackResultsParticipantPanel`) for both the parameter and the list, as it aligns with the intention of including feedback data in the participant panel.
   - Therefore, the parameter type should be changed to `InstructorResultsParticipantPanel` (from branch `a`), and the list type should be changed to `InstructorFeedbackResultsParticipantPanel` (from branch `b`).
