### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
throw _constructError("Numeric value (%s) out of range of `short`", getText());
||||||| base
throw _constructError("Numeric value ("+getText()+") out of range of Java short");
=======
throw new InputCoercionException(this,
                    String.format("Numeric value (%s) out of range of Java short", getText()),
                    JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT, Short.TYPE);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> " <WITH> %)
<REPLACE> + <WITH> s)
<DELETE> getText ( ) + "
<REPLACE> Java <WITH> `)
<ADD> ` , getText ( )


## From base to b
<REPLACE> _constructError <WITH> new)
<ADD> InputCoercionException ( this , <newline> String . format
<REPLACE> " <WITH> %)
<REPLACE> + <WITH> s)
<DELETE> getText ( ) + "
<ADD> , getText ( ) ) , <newline> JsonToken . VALUE_NUMBER_INT , Short . TYPE


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Replaced `"Java"` with "`Java`", adding backticks for formatting.
     - Changed `+getText()+` to `%s` and `getText()` for string formatting.
     - Used `_constructError` with a formatted message.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Replaced `_constructError` with `new InputCoercionException`.
     - Used `String.format` for message formatting.
     - Added additional parameters to the exception: `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT` and `Short.TYPE`.
     - Also changed `+getText()+` to `%s` and `getText()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The use of backticks around `Java short` is likely for code formatting or documentation clarity.
     - The switch to `%s` and `getText()` is a modernization to use string formatting instead of string concatenation.
     - The use of `_constructError` is likely a helper method for creating errors.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The switch to `InputCoercionException` is a more specific and meaningful exception type.
     - The use of `String.format` is consistent with modern Java practices.
     - The addition of `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT` and `Short.TYPE` provides more context for the exception, which is useful for debugging and error handling.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The intention is to modernize the string formatting and improve the readability of the error message.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The intention is to use a more specific exception type and provide additional context for the error, which is important for robust error handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in **branch b** are more comprehensive and provide better error handling by using a specific exception type and adding additional context.
   - The string formatting change in **branch a** is also valid and modern, but it is already included in **branch b**.
   - The use of backticks in **branch a** is a minor formatting change that is not essential for correctness or functionality.
   - Therefore, the resolution should incorporate the changes from **branch b**, as they provide a more robust and meaningful error handling mechanism.

# Final Resolution

```java
throw new InputCoercionException(this,
                String.format("Numeric value (%s) out of range of Java short", getText()),
                JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT, Short.TYPE);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
throw new InputCoercionException(this,
                    String.format("Numeric value (%s) out of range of `short`", getText()),
                    JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT, Short.TYPE);
