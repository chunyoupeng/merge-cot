### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

All content from the base has been removed

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** completely removed all content from the base. This suggests that `a` might have removed or replaced the entire class or method block.
   - **Branch `b`** added two new setter methods: `setSessionScopeTestGroupMetricPlotFetcher` and `setSessionScopeMonitoringMetricPlotFetcher`, both annotated with `@Required`. These methods are likely used to inject dependencies related to fetching metric plots for test groups and monitoring.

   The conflict arises because `a` removed everything, while `b` added new functionality.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing all content is a destructive change. It likely indicates that `a` is trying to remove or replace the entire class or functionality. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is intentional or a mistake.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding new methods is a constructive and likely necessary change. These methods appear to be part of a dependency injection pattern and are annotated with `@Required`, suggesting they are essential for the class to function.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention could be to remove or refactor the class entirely. However, this is a drastic change and may not be desirable unless the class is obsolete.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to extend the class with new dependencies, likely to support new features related to metric plotting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` removed all content, it would discard the new functionality added in `b`.
   - However, unless there is a strong reason to remove the class entirely (which is not evident from the information provided), it is better to preserve the new functionality from `b`.
   - Therefore, the resolution should be to **keep the new methods from `b`** and **discard the destructive change from `a`**.
