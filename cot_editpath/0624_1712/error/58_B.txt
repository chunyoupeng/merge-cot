### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> + getString ( R . string . select_repeat )
<DELETE> + " Select to see repeated element : " <newline>
<ADD> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> ( + 1 )
<REPLACE> mIndent <WITH> null)
<DELETE> <newline> + " Select to see repeated element : " + fc . getLongText ( ) + " " <newline> + fc . getMultiplicity ( )
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `a`, the string `"Select to see repeated element: "` is removed and replaced with `getString(R.string.select_repeat)`, which likely refers to a localized string resource. Additionally, a newline is added.
   - In `b`, the string `"Select to see repeated element: " + fc.getLongText() + " " + fc.getMultiplicity()` is completely removed, and `fc.getMultiplicity()` is replaced with `fc.getMultiplicity() + 1`. Also, `mIndent` is replaced with `null`, and a newline is added.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:**
     - Replacing the hardcoded string with a localized resource (`getString(R.string.select_repeat)`) is a good practice for internationalization.
     - The newline addition is likely for formatting purposes.
   - **Change in `b`:**
     - Incrementing `fc.getMultiplicity()` by 1 might be a logic change to adjust the multiplicity value for display.
     - Replacing `mIndent` with `null` could be an attempt to simplify the UI or remove indentation.
     - Removing the entire string and multiplicity display might be an attempt to simplify the UI or change the display logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention of `a`:** To improve internationalization by using a localized string.
   - **Intention of `b`:** To modify the display logic by removing the string and multiplicity display and incrementing the multiplicity value.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of `a` (internationalization) is more aligned with best practices and should be preserved.
   - The intention of `b` (changing the display logic) might be valid, but it should be combined with the internationalization change.
   - The newline addition from `a` should be preserved for formatting.
   - The increment of `fc.getMultiplicity()` from `b` should be applied to the localized string from `a`.

# Final resolution
```java
+ fc.getMultiplicity(), mIndent
                                + getString(R.string.select_repeat)
                                + (fc.getMultiplicity() + 1), null, Color.WHITE, CHILD, fc.getIndex()));
```

                                .getIndex()));
