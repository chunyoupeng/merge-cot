### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `BottomSheet.Builder` with `BottomBuilder`.
     - Changed `setTitle` to `addTitle`.
     - Changed `setItems` to `addItems`.
     - Modified the items array to include a third option "ShareQRCode" conditionally.
     - Changed the item types from `CharSequence[]` to `String[]`.
     - Updated the lambda signature and logic to handle the new third option.
     - Added a return statement `return Unit.INSTANCE;`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Added logic to show an `undoView` with different actions depending on the prefix of the copied string (`@`, `#`, `$`).
     - This logic is added inside the `Copy` case of the lambda.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The changes suggest a refactoring from `BottomSheet.Builder` to a new `BottomBuilder` class, possibly for a redesigned UI component.
     - The addition of a "ShareQRCode" option is a new feature, likely to allow users to share a QR code of the link.
     - The lambda signature and return type suggest a different API design, possibly for a Kotlin-style builder pattern.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The logic added is for user feedback (via `undoView`) after copying text, which is a UX improvement.
     - This logic is conditional and does not interfere with the existing functionality of opening or copying the link.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To refactor the UI component and add a new feature (QR code sharing).
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To enhance user feedback after copying text, improving the user experience.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `a` and `b` are orthogonal: one is a UI refactoring and feature addition, the other is a UX enhancement.
   - The `BottomBuilder` and its new API are likely incompatible with the `undoView` logic from `b`, as the lambda signature and return type differ.
   - To preserve both changes,

### Gold (Ground Truth)
BottomBuilder builder = new BottomBuilder(getParentActivity());
                    builder.addTitle(str);
                    builder.addItems(
                            new String[]{LocaleController.getString("Open", R.string.Open), LocaleController.getString("Copy", R.string.Copy), str.startsWith("#") || str.startsWith("$") ? null : LocaleController.getString("ShareQRCode", R.string.ShareQRCode)},
                            new int[]{R.drawable.baseline_open_in_browser_24, R.drawable.baseline_content_copy_24, R.drawable.wallet_qr}, (which, text, __) -> {
                                if (which == 0 || which == 2) {
                                    openClickableLink(str, which == 2);

                                } else if (which == 1) {
                                    AndroidUtilities.addToClipboard(str);
                                    if (str.startsWith("@")) {

                                    }
