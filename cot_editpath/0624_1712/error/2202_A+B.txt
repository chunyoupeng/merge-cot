### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> / / $ NON - NLS - 1 $ / / $ NON - NLS - 1 $ / / $ NON - NLS - 2 $ / / $ NON - NLS - 1 $ / / $ NON - NLS - 2 $


## From base to b
<ADD> { } <newline> { <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added `//$NON-NLS-1$` and `//$NON-NLS-2$` comments to the lines where `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. These are typically used in internationalization (i18n) to indicate that the string should not be localized.
   - **Branch `b`** added braces `{}` to the `if` statements, making the code more explicit and readable, especially for developers who prefer block-style conditionals.

   The conflict occurs in the same lines of code, where both branches made changes to the same lines.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is about adding localization comments. These are important if the codebase is internationalized and the strings should not be translated. The presence of these comments ensures that the build tools or i18n frameworks know to skip these strings.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is about improving code readability by adding braces to the `if` blocks. This is a common style preference and is generally considered good practice, especially in larger codebases or for maintainability.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to ensure that the error messages are not localized, which is important for debugging or for messages that should remain in English regardless of the user's locale.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to improve code readability and maintainability by making the structure of the `if` statements more explicit.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The localization comments are important for i18n, and the braces improve readability.
   - The best resolution is to **combine both changes**, keeping the localization comments and adding the braces for clarity.
   - This ensures that the code is both readable and correctly marked for internationalization.
