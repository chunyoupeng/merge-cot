### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

mHostUrlInput.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(0, 0, 0, 0);
        mRefreshButtonEnabled = false;
        
        if (!mHostUrlInputEnabled){
            mCheckServerButton.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); 
        }

        mRefreshButtonEnabled = false;*/
        mRefreshButton.setVisibility(View.GONE);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> <newline> if ( ! mHostUrlInputEnabled ) { <newline> mCheckServerButton . setVisibility ( View . INVISIBLE ) ; <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> / * * / <newline> mRefreshButton . setVisibility ( View . GONE ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a conditional block that sets `mCheckServerButton` to `INVISIBLE` if `mHostUrlInputEnabled` is false.
   - **Branch `b`** commented out the original lines (`mHostUrlInput.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(...)` and `mRefreshButtonEnabled = false`) and added a new line to set `mRefreshButton` to `GONE`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a conditional logic that hides the `mCheckServerButton` when the input is not enabled. This is a logical UI behavior and is likely intended to improve user experience by hiding irrelevant UI elements.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** removes the original logic and introduces a new UI behavior by hiding the `mRefreshButton`. This could be an attempt to simplify the UI or hide the refresh button under certain conditions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to conditionally hide a specific button (`mCheckServerButton`) based on the state of the input field.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to hide a different button (`mRefreshButton`) and possibly disable some other logic.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two changes are not mutually exclusive and affect different UI elements. Therefore, both changes can be merged.
   - The original lines commented out in `b` are not needed if the logic is no longer relevant, but the conditional logic from `a` is still valid and should be retained.
   - The final code should include both the conditional logic from `a` and the new visibility change from `b`.

```java
mHostUrlInput.setCompoundDrawablesWithIntrinsicBounds(0, 0, 0, 0);
        mRefreshButtonEnabled = false;
        
        if (!mHostUrlInputEnabled){
            mCheckServerButton.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE); 
        }
        mRefreshButton.setVisibility(View.GONE);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
mRefreshButton.setVisibility(View.GONE);
