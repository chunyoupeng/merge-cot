### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> deadline_countdown <WITH> deadline_countdown_text_view)
<REPLACE> deadline_countdown_unit <WITH> deadline_countdown_unit_text_view)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> protected @ Bind ( R . id . featured ) TextView featuredTextView ; <newline> protected @ Bind ( R . id . featured_group ) ViewGroup featuredViewGroup ; <newline> protected @ Bind ( R . id . friend_backing_avatar ) ImageView friendBackingAvatarImageView ; <newline> protected @ Bind ( R . id . friend_backing_message ) TextView friendBackingMessageTextView ; <newline> protected @ Bind ( R . id . friend_backing_group ) ViewGroup friendBackingViewGroup ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the resource IDs from `deadline_countdown` to `deadline_countdown_text_view` and `deadline_countdown_unit` to `deadline_countdown_unit_text_view`. This suggests that the UI element names were made more descriptive to improve clarity.
   - **Branch `b`** added several new `@Bind` annotations for new UI elements such as `featured`, `friend_backing_avatar`, etc. These are new components that were not present in the base version.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is a renaming of existing UI elements to be more descriptive. This is a common refactoring to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces new UI components, which likely support new features or UI enhancements. These additions are additive and do not conflict with the renaming in `a`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aimed to improve code clarity by renaming UI elements to be more descriptive.
   - **Branch `b`** aimed to add new UI components to support additional functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The renaming in `a` and the additions in `b` are complementary and do not conflict with each other. The renaming in `a` should be preserved to maintain clarity, and the new bindings in `b` should be added to support the new features.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to apply both changes: use the more descriptive names from `a` and include the new bindings from `b`.
