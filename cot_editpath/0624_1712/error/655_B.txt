### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , BlockStore blockStore
<DELETE> <newline>


## From base to b
<REPLACE> BlockMasterClient <WITH> <newline>)
<REPLACE> blockMasterClient <WITH> WorkerBlockMasterClient)
<ADD> workerBlockMasterClient
<REPLACE> FileSystemMasterClient <WITH> WorkerFileSystemMasterClient)
<REPLACE> fileSystemMasterClient <WITH> workerFileSystemMasterClient)
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> ( jiri )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Added a new parameter `BlockStore blockStore` to the constructor.
     - Removed a newline character (likely to reformat the code).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced `BlockMasterClient` with `WorkerBlockMasterClient`.
     - Replaced `blockMasterClient` with `WorkerBlockMasterClient` (parameter name).
     - Replaced `FileSystemMasterClient` with `WorkerFileSystemMasterClient`.
     - Replaced `fileSystemMasterClient` with `workerFileSystemMasterClient` (parameter name).
     - Added `(jiri)` to the TODO comment.
     - Removed a newline character (likely to reformat the code).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes**:
     - Adding `BlockStore blockStore` is a meaningful addition if the `BlockDataManager` needs to interact with a block store.
     - Removing a newline is a minor formatting change.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes**:
     - Replacing `BlockMasterClient` with `WorkerBlockMasterClient` and `FileSystemMasterClient` with `WorkerFileSystemMasterClient` suggests a refactoring to use worker-specific versions of these clients.
     - Renaming the parameter names to match the new client types is consistent with the refactoring.
     - Adding `(jiri)` to the TODO is a minor change to attribute the comment.
     - Removing a newline is a minor formatting change.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to enhance the `BlockDataManager` by adding a `BlockStore` dependency, which may be necessary for new functionality.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to refactor the code to use worker-specific client types, which may be part of a larger effort to modularize or specialize the code for worker processes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes.
   - The refactoring in `b` (worker-specific clients) and the addition in `a` (block store) can coexist.
   - The parameter names in `b` are more descriptive and should be retained.
   - The `BlockStore` parameter from `a` should be added to the constructor.
   - The `(jiri)` addition to the TODO is minor and can be retained.

# Final Resolution

```java
public BlockDataManager(WorkerSource workerSource,
      WorkerBlockMasterClient workerBlockMasterClient,
      WorkerFileSystemMasterClient workerFileSystemMasterClient,
      BlockStore blockStore) throws IOException {
    // TODO(jiri): We may not need to assign the conf to a variable
}
```
