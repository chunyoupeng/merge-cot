### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
protected void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode, final Intent intent) {
    if (requestCode != ActivityRequestCodes.PROJECT_ACTIVITY_LOGIN_TOUT_ACTIVITY_USER_REQUIRED) {
      return;
    }
||||||| base
protected void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode, final Intent intent) {
=======
protected void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode, @NonNull final Intent intent) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> if ( requestCode ! = ActivityRequestCodes . PROJECT_ACTIVITY_LOGIN_TOUT_ACTIVITY_USER_REQUIRED ) { <newline> return ; <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> @ NonNull


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a conditional check: `if (requestCode != ActivityRequestCodes.PROJECT_ACTIVITY_LOGIN_TOUT_ACTIVITY_USER_REQUIRED) { return; }`. This change introduces a specific logic to handle only a particular request code.
   - **Branch `b`** added the `@NonNull` annotation to the `intent` parameter, indicating that the method expects the `intent` to be non-null.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in **`a`** is a logic modification that restricts the method to only handle a specific request code. This is likely to prevent unnecessary processing for other request codes.
   - The change in **`b`** is a documentation and safety improvement. Adding `@NonNull` helps with code clarity and can be used by tools to enforce null safety at compile time.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **`a`** aims to optimize or specialize the behavior of `onActivityResult` to only handle a specific use case.
   - **`b`** aims to improve code safety and clarity by ensuring the `intent` is not null.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The conditional logic in `a` is a functional change, while the `@NonNull` annotation in `b` is a documentation and safety improvement.
   - These changes are not mutually exclusive and can be combined. The `@NonNull` annotation should be applied to the `intent` parameter, and the conditional logic should remain to handle the specific request code.
   - The final code should reflect both changes to ensure correctness and clarity.

```java
protected void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode, @NonNull final Intent intent) {
    if (requestCode != ActivityRequestCodes.PROJECT_ACTIVITY_LOGIN_TOUT_ACTIVITY_USER_REQUIRED) {
        return;
    }
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
protected void onActivityResult(final int requestCode, final int resultCode, @NonNull final Intent intent) {
    if (requestCode != ActivityRequestCodes.PROJECT_ACTIVITY_LOGIN_TOUT_ACTIVITY_USER_REQUIRED) {
      return;
    }
