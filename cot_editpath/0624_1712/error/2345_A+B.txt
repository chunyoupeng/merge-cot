### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **From base to a:** The `public` access modifier was removed from the `setMaxUsesPerCustomer` method. The method is now `void setMaxUsesPerCustomer(Long maxUses);`.
   - **From base to b:** Two new methods, `isUnlimitedUsePerCustomer()` and `isLimitedUsePerCustomer()`, were added. These methods provide logical checks based on the value of `getMaxUsesPerCustomer()`. The original method `setMaxUsesPerCustomer` remains unchanged in `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in a:** Removing the `public` modifier could be intentional to restrict access to the setter method. This might be done for encapsulation or to enforce controlled access to the field.
   - **Change in b:** Adding the two new methods enhances the API by providing derived boolean checks, which are useful for business logic. These methods are logically consistent with the existing `getMaxUsesPerCustomer()` method.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **a's intention:** To reduce the visibility of the setter method, possibly to prevent external modification of the field or to enforce internal logic.
   - **b's intention:** To enrich the API with helper methods that make it easier to determine the usage status of an offer based on the `maxUsesPerCustomer` value.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The removal of `public` from the setter in `a` is a valid encapsulation choice and should be preserved.
   - The addition of the two new methods in `b` is a logical and useful enhancement and should also be preserved.
   - The conflict is resolved by combining both changes: keeping the non-public setter from `a` and adding the two new methods from `b`.

```java
void setMaxUsesPerCustomer(Long maxUses);

    /**
     * Indicates that there is no limit to how many times a customer can use this offer. By default this is true if
     * {@link #getMaxUsesPerCustomer()} == 0
     */
    public boolean isUnlimitedUsePerCustomer();
    
    /**
     * Whether or not this offer has limited use in an order. By default this is true if {@link #getMaxUsesPerCustomer()} > 0
     */
    public boolean isLimitedUsePerCustomer();
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public void setMaxUsesPerCustomer(Long maxUses);

    /**
     * Indicates that there is no limit to how many times a customer can use this offer. By default this is true if
     * {@link #getMaxUsesPerCustomer()} == 0
     */
    public boolean isUnlimitedUsePerCustomer();
    
    /**
     * Whether or not this offer has limited use in an order. By default this is true if {@link #getMaxUsesPerCustomer()} > 0
     */
    public boolean isLimitedUsePerCustomer();
