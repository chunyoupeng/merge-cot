### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
INVALID_SCHEMAS("Schemas do not match; cannot port rows.", true),

    VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE("Must download new version of DataSync before jobs can be run (critical update)", true);
||||||| base
INVALID_SCHEMAS("Schemas do not match; cannot port rows.", true);
=======
INVALID_SCHEMAS("Schemas do not match; cannot port rows.", true),
    
    MISSING_METADATA_TITLE("Title is Required", true);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , <newline> <newline> VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE ( " Must download new version of DataSync before jobs can be run ( critical update ) " , true )


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> <newline> MISSING_METADATA_TITLE ( " Title is Required " , true )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, there is an enum constant `INVALID_SCHEMAS("Schemas do not match; cannot port rows.", true);`.
   - Branch `a` adds a new enum constant: `VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE("Must download new version of DataSync before jobs can be run (critical update)", true);`.
   - Branch `b` adds a different new enum constant: `MISSING_METADATA_TITLE("Title is Required", true);`.
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new enum constant after the same line in the base, and the order of enum constants matters in Java.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are adding new error messages that are logically distinct and valid.
   - `VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE` indicates a version-related issue, while `MISSING_METADATA_TITLE` indicates a missing metadata field.
   - Neither change is redundant or incorrect in isolation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to add a new error for version incompatibility.
   - The intention of `b` is to add a new error for missing metadata.
   - Both are valid and likely represent new error conditions that the system needs to handle.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are valid and non-conflicting in terms of logic, the correct resolution is to include both new enum constants.
   - The order of the enum constants should be preserved as per the original base, with both new additions appended in the order they were added in the branches.
   - Since `a` was added after `b` in the conflict, we can preserve the order by placing `MISSING_METADATA_TITLE` first and `VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE` second, or vice versa depending on the desired order.
   - For clarity and to avoid confusion, we will place the new constants in the order they were added in the conflict (i.e., `MISSING_METADATA_TITLE` first, then `VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE`).

```java
INVALID_SCHEMAS("Schemas do not match; cannot port rows.", true),
    
    MISSING_METADATA_TITLE("Title is Required", true),
    VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE("Must download new version of DataSync before jobs can be run (critical update)", true);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
INVALID_SCHEMAS("Schemas do not match; cannot port rows.", true),

    VERSION_OUT_OF_DATE("Must download new version of DataSync before jobs can be run (critical update)", true),

    MISSING_METADATA_TITLE("Title is Required", true);
