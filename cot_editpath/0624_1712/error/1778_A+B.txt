### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> sendToClientId <WITH> sendToClient)
<ADD> String context , filter ( e - > e . getKey ( ) . context . equals ( context ) ) <newline> .


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> List < SendingStreamObserver < PlatformOutboundInstruction > > stream = <newline> collect ( Collectors . toList ( ) ) ; <newline> stream .
<REPLACE> stream <WITH> s)
<REPLACE> stream <WITH> s)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Renamed the method from `sendToClientId` to `sendToClient`.
     - Added a new parameter `String context`.
     - Added a new filter condition to the stream: `.filter(e -> e.getKey().context.equals(context))`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Changed the method to collect the stream into a `List<SendingStreamObserver<PlatformOutboundInstruction>>` before iterating over it.
     - This change is likely for debugging or to allow for more complex operations on the list of streams.
     - No parameter or method name change was made.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The method name change (`sendToClientId` â†’ `sendToClient`) and the addition of the `context` parameter suggest a desire to filter connections not only by `clientId` but also by `context`.
     - This is a logical and useful enhancement if the system supports multiple contexts per client.
     - The new filter condition is a direct implementation of this logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The collection of the stream into a list is a minor change in behavior. It doesn't change the outcome of the method but may be useful for debugging or future expansion.
     - This change is not conflicting with the logic of `a` but adds a different kind of behavior.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to add filtering by `context` in addition to `clientId`, which implies a more granular control over which connections receive the instruction.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to collect the stream into a list, possibly for easier debugging or to allow for more complex operations on the list of streams.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method name change and the addition of the `context` parameter from `a` are significant and should be retained.
   - The filtering by `context` is a logical and necessary addition.
   - The collection of the stream into a list from `b` is a minor but useful addition that can be retained as well.
   - The final method should include both the `context` filtering and the collection into a list.

```java
public void sendToClient(String context, String clientId, PlatformOutboundInstruction instruction) {
    List<SendingStreamObserver<PlatformOutboundInstruction>> stream =
            connectionMap.entrySet().stream()
                         .filter(e -> e.getKey().clientId.equals(clientId))
                         .filter(e -> e.getKey().context.equals(context))
                         .map(Map.Entry::getValue)
                         .collect(Collectors.toList());
    stream.forEach(s -> s.onNext(instruction));
}
