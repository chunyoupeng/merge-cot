### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> ApiException |


## From base to b
<DELETE> ApiException | identity provider ' s <newline> " This means we cannot verify clients ' authentication tokens ourselves . " + <newline> " This might mean the authentication service is down or unavailable . " +


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed `ApiException |` from the `catch` clause, narrowing the exception type to only `RuntimeException`.
   - **Branch `b`** also removed `ApiException |`, but it also:
     - Removed the phrase "identity provider's" from the error message.
     - Split the message into two lines.
     - Retained the original message about not being able to verify tokens and the service possibly being down.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:**
     - The removal of `ApiException |` suggests that the code no longer needs to handle `ApiException` separately from `RuntimeException`, possibly because `ApiException` is now a subclass of `RuntimeException` or is no longer thrown in this context.
     - This change is minimal and focused on the exception type.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:**
     - The removal of "identity provider's" may indicate a shift in terminology or a simplification of the message.
     - The message is now split into two lines, which is a formatting change.
     - The message content is otherwise preserved, which suggests the intention is to keep the same meaning but with a slightly different phrasing.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to simplify the exception handling by removing an unnecessary or redundant exception type.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to simplify the message by removing the phrase "identity provider's" and reformatting the message for readability.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches aim to simplify the code in some way.
   - The message in `b` is more concise and avoids the term "identity provider's", which may be outdated or unnecessary.
   - The exception handling in `a` is more specific and avoids catching `ApiException`, which may be intentional.
   - The best resolution is to combine the exception handling from `a` with the message from `b`, as both changes are valid and non-conflicting in intent.
