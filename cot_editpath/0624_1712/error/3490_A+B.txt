### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
Integer maxPartitionsPerInsertBlock = 200;
||||||| base

=======
Long maxInsertBlockSize = 142L;
        Boolean insertDeduplicate = true;
        Boolean insertDistributedSync = true;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` have introduced new variables in the same context, but with different names and types.
   - Branch `a` introduces `Integer maxPartitionsPerInsertBlock = 200;`.
   - Branch `b` introduces `Long maxInsertBlockSize = 142L;`, `Boolean insertDeduplicate = true;`, and `Boolean insertDistributedSync = true;`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` introduces a configuration for the maximum number of partitions per insert block, which is an integer value.
   - `b` introduces a configuration for the maximum insert block size (a long value) and two boolean flags for deduplication and distributed sync.
   - All variables appear to be related to insert operations, but they serve different purposes:
     - `maxPartitionsPerInsertBlock` controls the number of partitions.
     - `maxInsertBlockSize` controls the size of the insert block.
     - `insertDeduplicate` and `insertDistributedSync` are flags for behavior control.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to limit the number of partitions per insert block, likely to manage resource usage or parallelism.
   - The intention in `b` is to configure the size of the insert block and enable additional features like deduplication and distributed synchronization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - All variables are distinct and serve different purposes, so there is no direct conflict in the logic.
   - The conflict is purely syntactic and arises from both branches adding new variables in the same scope.
   - The correct resolution is to merge all variables into the final code, ensuring they are properly ordered and formatted.
   - No variable needs to be discarded or modified, as they are all logically independent.
