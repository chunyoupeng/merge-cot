### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> }


## From base to b
<DELETE> new ArrayList < String > ( ) ,
<ADD> / / FIXME [ errorformat ] <newline> def ,


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** added a new line `}` at the end of the code block. This likely indicates that the code block was extended or restructured in a way that required an additional closing brace.
   - **Branch b** made two changes:
     - Removed `new ArrayList<String>(),` from the `PrettyPrintVisitor` constructor call.
     - Added a comment `// FIXME[errorformat]` and inserted `def,` as the first argument to the `TypeCheckingError` constructor.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change:** The addition of a closing brace suggests that the code structure was modified, possibly to add a new block or reorganize the logic. This change is likely syntactically necessary if the code was restructured.
   - **Branch b's changes:**
     - Removing `new ArrayList<String>(),` from the `PrettyPrintVisitor` constructor implies that the second argument is no longer needed or has been replaced by a default value.
     - Adding `def,` as the first argument to `TypeCheckingError` suggests that the method signature has changed to accept the `def` object as the first argument, followed by the message and location. This is a logical change if the error reporting system was updated to include the source of the error as a parameter.
     - The `// FIXME[errorformat]` comment indicates that the change is a temporary or pending fix, possibly related to formatting or logging.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To restructure or extend the code block, likely to add new functionality or fix a bug related to the logic in the `if` block.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To update the error reporting mechanism to include the `def` object as part of the error, and to simplify the `PrettyPrintVisitor` by removing an unnecessary parameter.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in **branch b** are more substantial and likely reflect an update to the error reporting system. The removal of the `ArrayList` and the addition of `def` as the first argument to `TypeCheckingError` are logical and necessary if the method signature has changed.
   - The change in **branch a** (adding a closing brace) is syntactically necessary if the code was restructured, but it doesn't provide any functional insight into the logic.
   - The `// FIXME[errorformat]` comment in **branch b** indicates that the change is a work in progress, but it still reflects the correct direction for the code.
   - Therefore, the resolution should prioritize the changes from **branch b**, as they reflect a more meaningful and functional update to the code.
