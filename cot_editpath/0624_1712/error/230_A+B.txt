### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Conflict Point Analysis**:
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `CompletableFuture<T>` with `ICompletableFuture<T>` in the method signature of `checkSync`.
     - This suggests that `a` is using an interface (`ICompletableFuture`) instead of a concrete class (`CompletableFuture`).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Deleted the entire set of private methods: `toData`, `invoke(Object, Address)`, and `invoke(Object)`.
     - This implies that `b` is removing these helper methods, possibly because they are no longer needed or are being replaced elsewhere.

2. **Evaluation of Changes**:
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - The replacement of `CompletableFuture<T>` with `ICompletableFuture<T>` is likely an abstraction or interface-based design change. This is a minimal and targeted change that could be useful if the codebase is moving toward using an interface for better testability or modularity.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The deletion of the helper methods is a more significant change. It could indicate that the functionality of these methods is being moved elsewhere or is no longer required. However, this deletion could break code that depends on these methods unless the functionality is replaced.

3. **Understanding the Intentions**:
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention appears to be to abstract the future type (`CompletableFuture`) into an interface (`ICompletableFuture`) for better flexibility or to align with a new API design.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention seems to be to remove unused or redundant helper methods, possibly to clean up the codebase or to refactor the invocation logic elsewhere.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - The change in `a` is minimal and likely safe to keep, especially if the codebase is moving toward using `ICompletableFuture`.
   - The deletion in `b` is more disruptive. If the helper methods are still used elsewhere in the codebase, they should be retained. If they are no longer needed, they can be safely removed.
   - Since the conflict is in the `checkSync` method, and `b` does not modify it, we should retain the change from `a` and ensure that the helper methods are either kept or replaced if necessary.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include the updated `checkSync` method from `a` and retain the helper methods unless they are confirmed to be obsolete.
