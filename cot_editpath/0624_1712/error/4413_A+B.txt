### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
else if (type == CONSTRUCTOR_NAME) {
        return new HaxeConstructorNameImpl(node);
      }
||||||| base

=======
else if (type == CONDITIONAL) {
        return new HaxeConditionalImpl(node);
      }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs at the `else if` condition and the corresponding return statement.
   - In `a`, the condition is `type == CONSTRUCTOR_NAME`, and it returns `new HaxeConstructorNameImpl(node)`.
   - In `b`, the condition is `type == CONDITIONAL`, and it returns `new HaxeConditionalImpl(node)`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are adding new branches to handle different types of nodes.
   - `a` is handling constructor names, while `b` is handling conditional expressions.
   - Since these are distinct types, the logic in both branches is likely orthogonal and should be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to introduce support for constructor name nodes.
   - The intention of `b` is to introduce support for conditional expressions.
   - Both changes are likely part of extending the parser or AST builder to handle more node types.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are handling different types and are not overlapping in logic, both should be retained.
   - The correct resolution is to merge both `else if` branches in the correct order, ensuring the logic is preserved and the code compiles correctly.
   - The order of the `else if` statements may matter depending on the logic of the `type` variable, but since both are distinct, the order can be preserved as in the original branches.

else if (type == CONSTRUCTOR_NAME) {
        return new HaxeConstructorNameImpl(node);
      }
      else if (type == CONDITIONAL) {
        return new HaxeConditionalImpl(node);
      }
```

else if (type == CONDITIONAL) {
        return new HaxeConditionalImpl(node);
      }
      else if (type == CONSTRUCTOR_NAME) {
        return new HaxeConstructorNameImpl(node);
      }
