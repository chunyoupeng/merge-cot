### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> Map < FlowType < IExplodedBasicBlock > , Set < FlowType < IExplodedBasicBlock > > > dfAnalysis = runDFAnalysis ( methodRef ) ; <newline> logger . debug ( dfAnalysis . toString ( ) ) ; <newline> <newline> MethodSummary summary = new MethodSummary ( methodRef ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The method `summarize` is unchanged in terms of logic or content. The only change is the formatting of the method's exception list and the indentation of the method body. Specifically, the exception list is formatted with each exception on a new line, and the method body is indented with tabs or spaces differently than in the base.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The method `summarize` is completely removed. The entire body of the method is deleted, including the creation of `methodRef`, the call to `runDFAnalysis`, the logging of the result, and the creation of the `MethodSummary`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The changes are purely stylistic and do not affect the functionality of the method. The formatting of the exception list and the indentation of the method body are subjective and do not alter the behavior of the code.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The deletion of the method body is a significant functional change. It removes the core logic of the method, rendering it non-functional. This suggests that branch `b` may be removing or refactoring the method entirely.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention appears to be to improve the code's formatting and readability without changing its behavior. This is a common practice in code maintenance and refactoring.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention appears to be to remove the method or its logic entirely. This could be part of a larger refactoring or removal of functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` only makes formatting changes and does not alter the method's functionality, it is safe to keep these changes.
   - Branch `b` removes the method's logic entirely, which is a more significant change. However, since the method is still present in branch `a`, it is likely that the method is still needed in the codebase.
   - Therefore, the appropriate resolution is to keep the method as it is in branch `a` and discard the changes from branch `b`.

# Final resolution
```java
public void summarize(String methodDescriptor)
		throws ClassHierarchyException, CallGraphBuilderCancelException,
		IOException, ParserConfigurationException {

	MethodReference methodRef = StringStuff
			.makeMethodReference(methodDescriptor);

	Map<FlowType<IExplodedBasicBlock>, Set<FlowType<IExplodedBasicBlock>>> dfAnalysis = runDFAnalysis(methodRef);
	logger.debug(dfAnalysis.toString());

	MethodSummary summary = new MethodSummary(methodRef);
}
