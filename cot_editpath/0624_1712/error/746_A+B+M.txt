### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaces the original logic of copying an input stream to a temporary file with a custom `OutputStream` that writes directly to a temporary file.
     - Uses `Files.newOutputStream(tmpPath, CREATE, TRUNCATE_EXISTING)` to create the file.
     - Removes the size validation logic (`copySize != digest.getSizeBytes()`) and instead introduces a `size` variable (not used).
     - Introduces a `flush()` method for the custom `OutputStream`.
     - **Intention**: Likely to optimize or customize the file writing process, possibly for performance or to integrate with a custom stream abstraction.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Keeps the logic of copying the input stream to a temporary file.
     - Adds a size validation check and throws an `IOException` if the size doesn't match the expected value.
     - Moves the file to the final destination after validation.
     - **Intention**: To ensure data integrity by validating the size of the copied file against the expected digest size.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The custom `OutputStream` is a significant architectural change. It may be useful if the system requires streaming or custom behavior, but it removes the size validation logic, which is a critical part of ensuring data integrity.
     - The `size` variable is declared but not used, which is a code smell.
     - The `flush()` method is added, but again, without a clear integration into the overall logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The size validation is a crucial part of ensuring correctness and data integrity.
     - The logic is straightforward and aligns with the original intent of the base code.
     - The error handling is improved by throwing an exception instead of silently returning `null`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be focused on replacing the file writing mechanism with a custom stream, possibly for performance or integration with a different system.
   - **Branch `b`** is focused on ensuring correctness and data integrity by validating the
