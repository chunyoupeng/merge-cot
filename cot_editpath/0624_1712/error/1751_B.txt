### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

private final boolean encrypted;
	private final boolean required;

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> final


## From base to b
<DELETE> final final final


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the variables `encrypted`, `required`, and `overridable` are declared as `final`.
   - In branch `a`, these variables are kept as `final`, and the variable `systemPropertyName` is also declared as `final`.
   - In branch `b`, the `final` keyword is removed from all three variables (`encrypted`, `required`, and `overridable`), making them non-final.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `final` to the variables implies an intention to make these fields immutable after initialization. This is a common practice in Java for ensuring thread safety and preventing unintended modifications.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Removing `final` suggests a need for these variables to be mutable, possibly for configuration or runtime modification purposes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To enforce immutability of the fields for better encapsulation and safety.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To allow runtime flexibility by making the fields mutable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The conflict centers around the `final` keyword for the variables `encrypted`, `required`, and `overridable`.
   - If the system requires these variables to be mutable (e.g., for dynamic configuration), then `b`'s change should be adopted.
   - If immutability is a design requirement (e.g., for thread safety or to prevent accidental changes), then `a`'s change should be adopted.
   - Since `a` also added `final` to `systemPropertyName`, which is not in conflict with `b`'s version (which already has `String systemPropertyName`), we can safely include that change.
   - Based on best practices in Java and the common use of `final` for configuration-like fields, we will prioritize `a`'s change to enforce immutability.
