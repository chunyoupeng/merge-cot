### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
else if (type == FINAL_META) {
        return new HaxeFinalMetaImpl(node);
      }
||||||| base

=======
else if (type == FAT_ARROW_EXPRESSION) {
        return new HaxeFatArrowExpressionImpl(node);
      }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**  
   - The conflict occurs at the same code block in both branches `a` and `b`.  
   - Branch `a` introduces a new `else if` condition for `FINAL_META` that returns a new instance of `HaxeFinalMetaImpl(node)`.  
   - Branch `b` introduces a new `else if` condition for `FAT_ARROW_EXPRESSION` that returns a new instance of `HaxeFatArrowExpressionImpl(node)`.  
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding new logic at the same location.

2. **Evaluate each change:**  
   - Both changes are adding new conditional logic to handle different types of expressions or metadata.  
   - Neither branch is overwriting the other; they are adding distinct functionality.  
   - The logic in both branches is semantically independent and does not conflict with each other.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**  
   - The intention of `a` is to handle the `FINAL_META` type by creating a specific implementation class.  
   - The intention of `b` is to handle the `FAT_ARROW_EXPRESSION` type by creating a specific implementation class.  
   - Both changes are likely part of extending the system to support new language features or metadata types.

4. **Final decision:**  
   - Since both branches are adding new, non-conflicting logic, the correct resolution is to merge both changes.  
   - The order of the `else if` statements may depend on the priority of the conditions, but since no such priority is indicated, we can preserve the order as presented in the conflict.

```java
else if (type == FINAL_META) {
        return new HaxeFinalMetaImpl(node);
      } else if (type == FAT_ARROW_EXPRESSION) {
        return new HaxeFatArrowExpressionImpl(node);
      }
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
else if (type == FAT_ARROW_EXPRESSION) {
        return new HaxeFatArrowExpressionImpl(node);
      }
      else if (type == FINAL_META) {
        return new HaxeFinalMetaImpl(node);
      }
