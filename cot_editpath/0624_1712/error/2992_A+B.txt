### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** replaces the traditional `try-catch` block with a more modern assertion style using `assertThatExceptionOfType(...).isThrownBy(...)`. It removes the `try-catch` structure and replaces it with a lambda-based assertion.
   - **Branch `b`** removes the entire `DefaultListableBeanFactory` instantiation and the associated test logic. This suggests that `b` may be removing or refactoring the test case entirely.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is modernizing the test code by using a more concise and expressive assertion style. This is a common practice in test frameworks like AssertJ and improves readability and maintainability.
   - **Branch `b`** is removing the test logic entirely, which could be due to deprecating the test or moving it elsewhere. However, this is a more destructive change and may not be desirable if the test is still relevant.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve the test code by making it more concise and readable.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to remove the test logic, possibly because it is no longer needed or is being moved to another location.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` is improving the test code and `b` is removing it, the more constructive and maintainable approach is to keep the improved test logic from `a`.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from `a` and discard the removal from `b`.

```java
DefaultListableBeanFactory lbf = new DefaultListableBeanFactory();
		assertThatExceptionOfType(NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.class).isThrownBy(() ->
				lbf.getBean(ConstructorDependency.class));
		assertThatExceptionOfType(NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.class).isThrownBy(() ->
				lbf.getBean(ConstructorDependency.class, 42));
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
assertThatExceptionOfType(NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.class).isThrownBy(() ->
				lbf.getBean(ConstructorDependency.class));
		assertThatExceptionOfType(NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.class).isThrownBy(() ->
				lbf.getBean(ConstructorDependency.class, 42));
