### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> PendingType canceledOr ( deployResult . getDeployState ( ) , ) <newline> requestManager . addToPendingQueue ( new SingularityPendingRequest ( requestId , deployId , timestamp , user , pendingType , commandLineArgs , runId , skipHealthChecks , message , Optional . absent ( ) , resources , runNowRequest . getRunAt ( ) ) ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> extraArtifacts ,


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the `canceledOr(deployResult.getDeployState(), PendingType.NEW_DEPLOY)` logic and instead directly assigned `pendingType = PendingType.NEW_DEPLOY`.
   - **Branch `b`** added the `extraArtifacts` parameter to the `SingularityPendingRequest` constructor call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** This simplifies the logic by hardcoding `pendingType` to `PendingType.NEW_DEPLOY`, removing the conditional logic from `base`. This could be intentional if the condition is no longer needed or if the logic is moved elsewhere.
   - **Change in `b`:** This adds a new parameter to the `SingularityPendingRequest` constructor, indicating that `extraArtifacts` is now a required or optional field in the request. This is likely a feature enhancement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to simplify or optimize the logic for determining `pendingType`, possibly because the `canceledOr` logic is no longer relevant or has been moved.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to enhance the `SingularityPendingRequest` with additional data (`extraArtifacts`), which may be needed for downstream processing.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The logic for `pendingType` in `a` and the addition of `extraArtifacts` in `b` are orthogonal changes. The `pendingType` logic can be updated to use the hardcoded value from `a`, while the `extraArtifacts` parameter from `b` should be retained in the constructor call.
   - The resolution should combine both changes: use `PendingType.NEW_DEPLOY` for `pendingType` and include `extraArtifacts` in the constructor.

```java
PendingType pendingType = PendingType.NEW_DEPLOY;
requestManager.addToPendingQueue(new SingularityPendingRequest(requestId, deployId, timestamp, user, pendingType, commandLineArgs, runId, skipHealthChecks, message, Optional.absent(), resources, extraArtifacts, runNowRequest.getRunAt()));
```
