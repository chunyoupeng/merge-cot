### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `InvalidPropertyValueException` with `IllegalArgumentException`.
     - This is a change in the exception type being thrown.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Renamed the method from `illegalPropertyType` to `illegalFeatureType`.
     - Changed the method signature to accept `FeatureAssociationRole`, `FeatureType expected`, and `FeatureType actual`.
     - Replaced `GenericName` with `FeatureAssociationRole`, `Object` with `FeatureType`, and added a new parameter `FeatureType actual`.
     - Changed `Errors` to `Resources` and the error key from `IllegalPropertyValueClass_2` to `IllegalFeatureType_3`.
     - Updated the message formatting to use `getName()` on the new parameters.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change from `InvalidPropertyValueException` to `IllegalArgumentException` is a simplification. It suggests that the method is now throwing a more general exception, possibly to reduce the number of custom exceptions or to align with a broader error-handling strategy.
     - This change is minimal and does not conflict with the structure of the method.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The method has been significantly refactored to handle feature types instead of generic properties.
     - This suggests a more specific use case where the method is now validating feature types in a feature association context.
     - The method is now more descriptive and tailored to a specific domain (e.g., geospatial or feature modeling).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is likely to simplify the exception hierarchy by using a standard exception type (`IllegalArgumentException`) instead of a custom one.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to specialize the method for a specific use case involving feature associations and feature types, making it more precise and domain-specific.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `b` are more substantial and indicate a clear shift in the method's purpose and usage.
   - The change in `a` is a minor simplification that does not conflict with the more specific method in `b`.
   - Since `b` provides a more detailed and domain-specific implementation, it should be the basis for the resolution.
   - The exception type from `a` (`IllegalArgumentException`) can be incorporated into `b`'s method to maintain consistency with the exception strategy.

# Final Resolution

```java
private static IllegalArgumentException illegalFeatureType(
        final FeatureAssociationRole association, final FeatureType expected, final FeatureType actual)
{
    return new IllegalArgumentException(Resources.format(Resources.Keys.IllegalFeatureType_3,
            association.getName(), expected.getName(), actual.getName()));
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
private static IllegalArgumentException illegalFeatureType(
            final DefaultAssociationRole association, final FeatureType expected, final FeatureType actual)
    {
        return new IllegalArgumentException(Resources.format(Resources.Keys.IllegalFeatureType_3,
                association.getName(), expected.getName(), actual.getName()));
