### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

* This is a custom location - don't call encodeRedirectURL() and don't add context path, just
                         * redirect to the encoded URL

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> *
<ADD> <newline> *


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> *
<DELETE> <newline> *
<ADD> <newline> *


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in a multi-line comment explaining the logic of a custom redirect.
   - **Base version:** The comment says:  
     ```
     * This is a custom location - don't call encodeRedirectURL()
                         * and don't add context path, just redirect to the encoded URL
     ```
     It is a single paragraph with two lines.
   - **Branch a:**  
     ```
     * This is a custom location - don't call encodeRedirectURL() and don't add context path, just
                         * redirect to the encoded URL
     ```
     The change is that the first line now includes the phrase "and don't add context path", which was previously in the second line.
   - **Branch b:**  
     ```
     * This is a custom location - don't call
                         * encodeRedirectURL() and don't add context path, just
                         * redirect to the encoded URL
     ```
     The change is that the phrase "don't call" is now on a separate line, and a new line is added for "just redirect to the encoded URL".

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change:** It merges the phrase "and don't add context path" into the first line. This makes the first line longer but keeps the logic in a single line.
   - **Branch b's change:** It splits the phrase "don't call" into a separate line and adds a new line for the final instruction. This increases readability by separating each instruction into its own line.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To make the logic more compact by combining related phrases into a single line.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To improve readability by separating each instruction into its own line, making it easier to read and understand.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of both branches is to improve the clarity of the comment.
   - Branch b's version is more readable and better structured, especially for developers who may not be familiar with the logic.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should adopt the structure from branch b but incorporate the content from branch a to ensure all instructions are included.
   - The final version should clearly state each instruction in a separate line for maximum readability.
