### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Removed the `String json = "[]";` line.
     - Replaced `newMapper()` with `READER.with(...)`.
     - Used `with(...)` instead of `configure(...)` for setting features.
     - Replaced `true` with a newline and added `DeserializationFeature.ACCEPT_EMPTY_ARRAY_AS_NULL_OBJECT` in the same `with(...)` call.
     - Removed the `configure(...)` call for `ACCEPT_EMPTY_ARRAY_AS_NULL_OBJECT`.
     - Replaced `aposToQuotes(json)` with `")` and `json` with `])`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Removed the `String json = "[]";` line.
     - Replaced `newMapper()` with `mapperBuilder()`.
     - Added a `build()` call.
     - Replaced `aposToQuotes(json)` with `")` and `json` with `])`.

   The main conflict is in the way the `ObjectMapper` is configured and built. Branch `a` uses `READER.with(...)` and `with(...)` for configuration, while branch `b` uses `mapperBuilder().build()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The use of `with(...)` is a valid way to configure the `ObjectMapper`, but it's less common and might be less readable.
     - The removal of `configure(...)` for `ACCEPT_EMPTY_ARRAY_AS_NULL_OBJECT` could be intentional or an oversight.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The use of `mapperBuilder().build()` is a more modern and idiomatic way to configure the `ObjectMapper`, especially in newer versions of Jackson.
     - It's more readable and aligns with best practices for building and configuring `ObjectMapper`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** seems to be trying to simplify the configuration by using `with(...)` and removing the `String json` variable.
   - **Branch b** is likely modernizing the code by using the `mapperBuilder()` pattern, which is more flexible and readable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Branch `b`'s approach is more idiomatic and readable, especially for newer versions of Jackson.
   - The `mapperBuilder().build()` pattern is preferred for clarity and maintainability.
   - The `with(...)` approach from branch `a` is less common and might be confusing to other developers.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the `mapperBuilder().build()` pattern from branch `b`, while retaining the configuration features from both branches.

    			.build()
    			.readerFor(ZoneOffset.class).readValue("[]");
