### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the Java method `getBalancesStatement` and its associated Javadoc comment.
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - No visible changes in the method signature.
     - The Javadoc comment is unchanged from the base.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The Javadoc comment has been significantly modified:
       - The sentence "If you do not specify the referencing <tt>tips</tt>" is changed to "If the <tt>tips</tt> parameter is missing".
       - The phrase "based on the latest confirmed milestone" is changed to "correct as of the latest confirmed milestone".
       - The description of the `addresses` parameter is changed from "The addresses where we will find the balance for" to "Address for which to get the balance (do not include the checksum)".
       - A new annotation `@Document(name="getBalances")` is added.
       - The line "Returns an {@link ErrorResponse} if tips are not found
