### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

* add any servlet filters that should be called before resource handling
   */
  protected void configurePreResourceHandling(ServletContextHandler context) {}

  /**
||||||| base

=======
* expose SslContextFactory
   */
  protected SslContextFactory getSslContextFactory() {
    return this.sslContextFactory;
  }

  /**
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the same file, but the base is empty. This means both branches `a` and `b` independently added content to the file.
   - Branch `a` added a method `configurePreResourceHandling(ServletContextHandler context)` with a comment about adding servlet filters before resource handling.
   - Branch `b` added a method `getSslContextFactory()` that returns an `SslContextFactory`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both methods appear to be valid and serve different purposes:
     - `configurePreResourceHandling` is for configuring filters before resource handling.
     - `getSslContextFactory` is for exposing an SSL context factory.
   - Neither method is a duplicate or conflicting with the other in terms of functionality or naming.
   - There is no overlap in the code added by `a` and `b`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to allow customization of pre-resource handling filters, likely for security or logging purposes.
   - The intention of `b` is to provide access to the SSL context factory, likely for external configuration or reuse.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both methods into the final file.
   - No code needs to be discarded or modified.
   - The final file should include both methods as they are.

  /**

  /**

  protected SslContextFactory getSslContextFactory() {
    return this.sslContextFactory;
  }
