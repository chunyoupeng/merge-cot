### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> static EarlyAccessFeature TURN_PROXY = new EarlyAccessFeature ( " turn . proxy " , " TURN Proxy Service " , false ) ;


## From base to b
<DELETE> static
<ADD> <newline> EarlyAccessFeature WSN_302_REDIRECT = new EarlyAccessFeature ( " wsn . 302 . redirect " , " Send redirect for wsn via 302 " , false ) ; <newline> EarlyAccessFeature WSX_302_REDIRECT = new EarlyAccessFeature ( " wsx . 302 . redirect " , " Send redirect for wsx via 302 " , false ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new `EarlyAccessFeature` called `TURN_PROXY` with the description "TURN Proxy Service".
   - **Branch `b`** removed the `static` modifier from the `HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE` declaration and added two new `EarlyAccessFeature` entries: `WSN_302_REDIRECT` and `WSX_302_REDIRECT`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** The addition of `TURN_PROXY` is a new feature and is likely intended to be used in a static context (as it was declared `static` in `a`). This change is straightforward and additive.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The removal of `static` from `HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE` might indicate a shift in usage pattern (e.g., from a static configuration to an instance-based one). The addition of `WSN_302_REDIRECT` and `WSX_302_REDIRECT` introduces new features related to redirect handling for WSN and WSX protocols.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to introduce a new static proxy-related feature (`TURN_PROXY`) without affecting the existing `HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE`.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to refactor the usage of `HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE` and introduce new redirect-related features for WSN and WSX protocols.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `static` modifier in `a` should be preserved for `TURN_PROXY` as it aligns with the original static declaration of `HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE`.
   - The removal of `static` in `b` for `HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE` should be preserved if the intention is to change its usage pattern.
   - The new features from both branches (`TURN_PROXY`, `WSN_302_REDIRECT`, `WSX_302_REDIRECT`) should all be included.
   - The final code should reflect both changes in a consistent and readable format.

# Final Resolution
```java
EarlyAccessFeature HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE = new EarlyAccessFeature("http.proxy", "HTTP Proxy Service", false);
    static EarlyAccessFeature TURN_PROXY = new EarlyAccessFeature("turn.proxy", "TURN Proxy Service", false);
    EarlyAccessFeature WSN_302_REDIRECT = new EarlyAccessFeature("wsn.302.redirect", "Send redirect for wsn via 302", false);
    EarlyAccessFeature WSX_302_REDIRECT = new EarlyAccessFeature("wsx.302.redirect", "Send redirect for wsx via 302", false);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
EarlyAccessFeature HTTP_PROXY_SERVICE = new EarlyAccessFeature("http.proxy", "HTTP Proxy Service", false);
    EarlyAccessFeature WSN_302_REDIRECT = new EarlyAccessFeature("wsn.302.redirect", "Send redirect for wsn via 302", false);
    EarlyAccessFeature WSX_302_REDIRECT = new EarlyAccessFeature("wsx.302.redirect", "Send redirect for wsx via 302", false);
    EarlyAccessFeature TURN_PROXY = new EarlyAccessFeature("turn.proxy", "TURN Proxy Service", false);
