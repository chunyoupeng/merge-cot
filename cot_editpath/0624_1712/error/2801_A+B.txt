### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> AbstractNode <WITH> AbstractJjtreeNode)
<ADD> < ModelicaNode >
<DELETE> Node ,


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> / * * <newline> * Kind for implicit tokens . Negative because JavaCC only picks <newline> * positive numbers for token kinds . <newline> * / <newline> private static final int IMPLICIT_TOKEN = - 1 ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `AbstractNode` with `AbstractJjtreeNode<ModelicaNode>`.
     - Removed the `Node` interface from the list of implemented interfaces.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a new static final field `IMPLICIT_TOKEN = -1` with a detailed Javadoc comment.
     - No changes to the class declaration or inheritance structure.

   The conflict is in the class declaration line. `a` changes the inheritance and interface implementation, while `b` adds a new field and comment.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change to `AbstractJjtreeNode<ModelicaNode>` suggests a move toward a more specific or generic base class, possibly for better type safety or to align with a new architecture.
     - Removing `Node` implies that the `Node` interface is no longer needed or is redundant with `ModelicaNode`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `IMPLICIT_TOKEN` is a semantic enhancement, likely for token handling in the parser. It introduces a new constant with a clear purpose and documentation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to refactor the class hierarchy for better type safety or to integrate with a new framework (`AbstractJjtreeNode`).
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to enhance the semantic clarity of the code by introducing a named constant for implicit tokens, improving readability and maintainability.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The class declaration from `a` should be adopted because it reflects a more modern or specific inheritance structure.
   - The addition of `IMPLICIT_TOKEN` from `b` should be preserved as it adds semantic value and clarity.
   - The `Node` interface is removed in `a`, so it should not be reintroduced.
   - The final class declaration should reflect the updated inheritance from `a`, and the new field from `b` should be added.
