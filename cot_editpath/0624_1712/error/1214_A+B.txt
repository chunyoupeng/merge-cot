### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
oper.setRightArg(rightArgTypeCtx.getText());
                addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper);
||||||| base
oper.setRightArg(rightArgTypeCtx.getText());
                addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper, operSchemaName);
=======
oper.setRightArg(getTypeName(rightArgTypeCtx));
                addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper, operSchemaName);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> , operSchemaName


## From base to b
<ADD> getTypeName (
<DELETE> . getText (


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     oper.setRightArg(rightArgTypeCtx.getText());
     addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper, operSchemaName);
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is:
     ```java
     oper.setRightArg(rightArgTypeCtx.getText());
     addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper);
     ```
     So, `a` removed the third argument `operSchemaName` from the `addTypeAsDepcy` method call.
   - In branch `b`, the line is:
     ```java
     oper.setRightArg(getTypeName(rightArgTypeCtx));
     addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper, operSchemaName);
     ```
     So, `b` changed the argument to `setRightArg` from `rightArgTypeCtx.getText()` to `getTypeName(rightArgTypeCtx)`, and kept the third argument in `addTypeAsDepcy`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** removed `operSchemaName` from `addTypeAsDepcy`. This suggests that the method no longer requires the schema name, or it is being handled differently elsewhere.
   - **Branch `b`** replaced `getText()` with `getTypeName(...)`, which implies that `getTypeName` is a helper method that returns a more appropriate or normalized type name than `getText()`. This is likely a correctness or consistency improvement.
   - The `addTypeAsDepcy` method in both `a` and `b` appears to be consistent in its first two arguments, but `a` omits the third.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to simplify the method call by removing an unnecessary parameter (`operSchemaName`).
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to improve the correctness or clarity of the type name passed to `setRightArg`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `b` to use `getTypeName(...)` is likely the correct and more robust approach for retrieving the type name.
   - The removal of `operSchemaName` in `a` may be valid if the method `addTypeAsDepcy` no longer requires it, but we should retain it unless we are certain it is no longer needed.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the `getTypeName(...)` from `b` and retain the third argument in `addTypeAsDepcy` unless there is evidence that it is no longer needed.

oper.setRightArg(getTypeName(rightArgTypeCtx));
addTypeAsDepcy(rightArgTypeCtx, oper, operSchemaName);
