### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
stat = Status.LAUNCHED;
||||||| base
stat = Status.PENDING;
=======
statusMessage = "Query is pending in HiveServer";
        stat = Status.PENDING;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> PENDING <WITH> LAUNCHED)


## From base to b
<ADD> statusMessage = " Query is pending in HiveServer " ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is: `stat = Status.PENDING;`.
   - In branch `a`, the line is changed to: `stat = Status.LAUNCHED;`.
   - In branch `b`, a new line is added before the original line: `statusMessage = "Query is pending in HiveServer";`, and the original line remains unchanged: `stat = Status.PENDING;`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** changes the status from `PENDING` to `LAUNCHED`. This likely reflects a change in the state of the system, indicating that the task or query has moved from a pending state to a launched state.
   - **Branch `b`** adds a message to indicate that the query is still pending in HiveServer. This suggests that the system is still waiting for the query to be processed, and the message is for user or system feedback.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to reflect that the query has been launched and is no longer pending.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to provide additional feedback that the query is still pending in HiveServer, possibly for logging or UI purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two changes are not mutually exclusive. The status can be updated to `LAUNCHED` while still providing a message that the query is pending in HiveServer. This could be the case if the system considers the query as "launched" from the application's perspective, but it is still pending in the backend (HiveServer).
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to **keep both changes**: update the status to `LAUNCHED` and retain the message about the query being pending in HiveServer.

```java
statusMessage = "Query is pending in HiveServer";
        stat = Status.LAUNCHED;
```
