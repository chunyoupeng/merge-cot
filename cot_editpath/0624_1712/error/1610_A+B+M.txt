### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> singleType <WITH> keyWordYearMonthDuration)
<REPLACE> simpleType <WITH> keyWordDayTimeDuration)
<ADD> " , <newline> " keyWordHexBinary " , " keyWordBase64Binary " , " keyWordDateTime " , " keyWordDate " , <newline> " singleType
<DELETE> <newline>
<ADD> <newline>
<DELETE> " , <newline> " keyWords

## From base to b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `"simpleType"` with `"keyWordDayTimeDuration"`.
     - Replaced `"singleType"` with `"keyWordYearMonthDuration"`.
     - Added `"keyWordHexBinary"`, `"keyWordBase64Binary"`, `"keyWordDateTime"`, `"keyWordDate"`, and `"singleType"` (which was previously removed).
     - Removed `"keyWords"` from the end and added it back at the end.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Added `"keyWordYearMonthDuration"`, `"keyWordDateTime"`, `"keyWordDate"`, `"keyWordTime"`, `"keyWordDayTimeDuration"`, and `"typeKeyWords"`.
     - Removed and restructured newlines.

   The conflict is in the list of keywords, where both branches added or modified similar entries.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding duration-related keywords (`keyWordYearMonthDuration`, `keyWordDayTimeDuration`) and date/time-related keywords (`keyWordDateTime`, `keyWordDate`, `keyWordTime`).
   - Branch `a` also added `keyWordHexBinary` and `keyWordBase64Binary`, which are data type keywords.
   - Branch `b` added `typeKeyWords`, which seems to be a category or grouping of keywords.
   - The order and formatting differ slightly, but the intent appears to be to enrich the list of keywords for data types and durations.

3. **Understand the intention:**
   - The intention of both branches is to expand the list of keywords to support more data types and durations.
   - Branch `a` focuses on adding binary and date/time types.
   - Branch `b` focuses on adding more granular time-related keywords and a category (`typeKeyWords`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most comprehensive list should include all the keywords from both branches.
   - The order should be logical: first the boolean and duration keywords, then the binary types, then the date/time types, followed by the category (`typeKeyWords`), and finally the structural keywords like `singleType`, `simpleType`, etc.
   - The formatting should be consistent with the original base (indentation and newlines).
