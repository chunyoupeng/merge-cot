### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (experimentTitle.equals(context.getString(R.string.astable_multivibrator)))
                    return ExperimentDocFragment.newInstance("J_Astable.md");
||||||| base

if (experimentTitle.equals(context.getString(R.string.light_dependent_resistor)))
                    return ExperimentDocFragment.newInstance("K_LDR.md");
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a single line of code that maps an experiment title to a specific fragment.
   - In `a`, the condition checks for the experiment title "Astable Multivibrator" and returns the fragment "J_Astable.md".
   - In `b`, the condition checks for the experiment title "Light Dependent Resistor" and returns the fragment "K_LDR.md".
   - The base is empty, meaning both branches independently added their own mapping.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are valid and likely represent adding new experiments to the application.
   - The intention in `a` is to add support for the "Astable Multivibrator" experiment.
   - The intention in `b` is to add support for the "Light Dependent Resistor" experiment.
   - Neither change is incorrect or conflicting in logic; they are simply adding different features.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both branches is to expand the list of supported experiments.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in the logic of the two branches.
   - The only conflict is that both branches added a new condition to the same block of code, which is now empty in the base.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and non-conflicting, the correct resolution is to combine both conditions.
   - The code should check for both experiment titles and return the appropriate fragment for each.
   - This preserves the functionality of both branches and ensures both experiments are supported.
