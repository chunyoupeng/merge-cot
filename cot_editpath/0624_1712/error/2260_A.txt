### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - `a` added the following imports:
     - `import us.ihmc.robotics.math.trajectories.waypoints.FrameSE3TrajectoryPoint;`
     - `import us.ihmc.robotics.math.trajectories.waypoints.SimpleTrajectoryPoint1D;`
   - `b` did not add any new imports beyond what is already in the base.
   - Both `a` and `b` include the import `import us.ihmc.robotics.math.trajectories.waypoints.MultipleWaypointsTrajectoryGenerator;`, and `ReferenceFrame` is also common.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The import `MultipleWaypointsTrajectoryGenerator` is common to both branches, so it should be retained.
   - The import `ReferenceFrame` is also common and should be retained.
   - The imports `FrameSE3TrajectoryPoint` and `SimpleTrajectoryPoint1D` are specific to branch `a`. If the code in `a` uses these classes, they should be retained.
   - Branch `b` does not add any new imports, so it does not introduce any new dependencies.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` seems to be adding support for more specific trajectory point types (`FrameSE3TrajectoryPoint` and `SimpleTrajectoryPoint1D`), likely to support more complex trajectory generation logic.
   - Branch `b` does not appear to be adding any new functionality related to trajectory points, so it does not require the additional imports.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the base is empty and both branches are adding imports, we should merge the imports from both branches.
   - However, since `b` does not add any new imports, we only need to include the imports from `a` and the common ones from both branches.
   - The imports should be ordered logically and consistently.
