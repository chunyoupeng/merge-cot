### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the word "streaming" to the comment: 
     ```
     * Returns service that can be used to access streaming market data.
     ```
     This change modifies the description to clarify that the service provides streaming market data.
   - **Branch `b`** added a large block of new methods and comments:
     ```
     * Observable for disconnection event.
     * ...
     * Returns service that can be used to access market data.
     ```
     This change introduces new methods related to observables for disconnection events, message delay measurement, and resubscription functionality.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is minimal and descriptive. It clarifies the nature of the market data service as "streaming," which is a logical and helpful addition.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is more substantial and introduces new functionality. It adds methods that are likely part of a broader effort to support reactive programming patterns (e.g., using RxJava's `Observable`) for handling events like disconnection and message delay.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve clarity and specificity in the documentation of the service.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to expand the API with new features to support event-driven and reactive behavior in the client.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes from **branch `a`** and **branch `b`** are orthogonal: one is a documentation improvement, and the other is a feature addition.
   - The addition of "streaming" in the comment from `a` should be preserved to maintain clarity.
   - The new methods from `b` should also be preserved as they provide new functionality.
   - The conflict arises because both changes modify the same line in the base file. The resolution is to merge the two changes by combining the updated comment from `a` with the new methods from `b`.
