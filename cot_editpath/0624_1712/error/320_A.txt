### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public AbstractIdentifiedType getResult() {
||||||| base
public IdentifiedType getResult() {
=======
@Override
    public IdentifiedType getResult() {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> IdentifiedType <WITH> AbstractIdentifiedType)


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Override <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method signature is: `public IdentifiedType getResult()`.
   - In branch `a`, the return type `IdentifiedType` is replaced with `AbstractIdentifiedType`.
   - In branch `b`, the method is annotated with `@Override`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a` change:** Changing the return type from `IdentifiedType` to `AbstractIdentifiedType` suggests that the method is now returning a more general or abstract type. This could be for flexibility or to align with a new design where `AbstractIdentifiedType` is the base class.
   - **Branch `b` change:** Adding `@Override` indicates that the method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface. This is a good practice for clarity and correctness in object-oriented programming.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To generalize the return type, possibly to allow for polymorphism or to align with a new class hierarchy.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To explicitly declare that this method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface, which is a good practice for maintainability and readability.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The return type change in `a` is structural and likely necessary for the new design. The `@Override` annotation in `b` is a good practice and should be retained.
   - The correct resolution is to combine both changes: use `AbstractIdentifiedType` as the return type and include the `@Override` annotation.
