### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added new code to a file that was empty in the base.
   - Branch `a` added a method `updateTempInput(String inputText, String tempUserDisplayInput)` that sets temporary input values for an `inputBox`.
   - Branch `b` added a method `makeGeoIndependent()` that ensures a `linkedGeo` object is independent, and also added the same `updateTempInput` method as in `a`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `updateTempInput` method is identical in both `a` and `b`, so it should be kept once without duplication.
   - The `makeGeoIndependent` method is unique to `b` and appears to handle a specific logic related to geometry objects. It should be included in the final merge if it is relevant to the overall functionality.
   - Since both branches added the same method, it's likely that the `updateTempInput` method is a shared utility or a common requirement, and both branches independently added it.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` seems to be to provide a way to update temporary input values for an input box.
   - The intention of `b` is to ensure that a geometry object is independent and to also provide the same input update functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches added the same `updateTempInput` method, we will include it once.
   - The `makeGeoIndependent` method from `b` is unique and should be included as well.
   - The final merged code should include both methods without duplication.
