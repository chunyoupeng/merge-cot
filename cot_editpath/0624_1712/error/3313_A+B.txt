### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
", additionalAcceptedMediaTypes=" + additionalAcceptedMediaTypes +
||||||| base

=======
", queryParamsAsHeaders=" + queryParamsAsHeaders +
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a string concatenation line.
   - In `a`, the string includes `", additionalAcceptedMediaTypes=" + additionalAcceptedMediaTypes +`.
   - In `b`, the string includes `", queryParamsAsHeaders=" + queryParamsAsHeaders +`.
   - The base is empty, so both `a` and `b` are adding new content independently.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` is adding a new parameter `additionalAcceptedMediaTypes` to the string.
   - `b` is adding a new parameter `queryParamsAsHeaders` to the string.
   - Both changes are valid and likely represent different features or configurations being added to the system.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to include a new media type configuration in the string.
   - The intention of `b` is to include a new header configuration for query parameters.
   - Both parameters are likely intended to be part of the final string, as they represent separate concerns.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both parameters are being added independently and do not conflict with each other, the correct resolution is to include both in the final string.
   - The order of the parameters may not be critical, but it's best to preserve the order from the original branches if possible.
   - In this case, since both branches are adding to an empty base, the order can be preserved as in the original branches.
