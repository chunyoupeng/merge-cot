### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
/**
 * @deprecated since 5.0 should not be an API. Everything should be accessed using {@link SensorContext}.
 */
@Deprecated
||||||| base

=======
/**
 * @deprecated since 4.5.2 should not be used by plugins.
 */
@Deprecated
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the deprecation message of a method or class.
   - In branch `a`, the deprecation message is: "since 5.0 should not be an API. Everything should be accessed using {@link SensorContext}."
   - In branch `b`, the deprecation message is: "since 4.5.2 should not be used by plugins."
   - Both branches added the `@Deprecated` annotation, but with different deprecation reasons and versions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` emphasizes that the method/class should no longer be an API and suggests an alternative (`SensorContext`).
   - Branch `b` focuses on deprecating the method/class for plugin usage, starting from version 4.5.2.
   - Both changes are valid but serve different purposes: `a` is about API design, while `b` is about plugin compatibility.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to guide developers to use a new API (`SensorContext`) and remove the old API.
   - The intention in `b` is to prevent plugins from using the deprecated method/class and to enforce a version-based deprecation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both intentions are valid and complementary, the best resolution is to combine the two deprecation messages.
   - The version in `b` (4.5.2) is earlier than in `a` (5.0), so the deprecation should start at 4.5.2.
   - The message should include both the plugin usage warning and the API guidance.
