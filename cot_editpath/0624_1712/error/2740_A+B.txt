### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

public HeartbeatExtensionPreparator(Chooser chooser, HeartbeatExtensionMessage message) {
        super(chooser, message);
        this.message = message;

public HeartbeatExtensionPreparator(TlsContext context, HeartbeatExtensionMessage message) {

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> TlsContext <WITH> Chooser)
<REPLACE> context <WITH> chooser)
<REPLACE> context <WITH> chooser)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> message <WITH> msg)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the constructor is defined as:
     ```java
     public HeartbeatExtensionPreparator(TlsContext context, HeartbeatExtensionMessage message) {
         super(context, message);
         this.message = message;
     }
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the first parameter of the constructor is changed from `TlsContext context` to `Chooser chooser`, and the variable name is also changed from `context` to `chooser`. The rest of the code remains the same.
   - In branch `b`, the variable name `message` is changed to `msg`. The rest of the code remains the same.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** The change from `TlsContext context` to `Chooser chooser` suggests that the constructor is now accepting a `Chooser` object instead of a `TlsContext`. This is a significant change in the method signature and likely reflects a design decision to use a different abstraction (`Chooser`) instead of `TlsContext`. This change is likely intentional and meaningful.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The change from `message` to `msg` is a simple renaming of a variable. This is a cosmetic change and does not affect the logic of the code. It is likely done for brevity or to follow a different naming convention.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to refactor the constructor to use a `Chooser` object instead of a `TlsContext`. This could be part of a larger refactoring to decouple the class from `TlsContext` and use a more specific or abstract interface (`Chooser`).
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to rename the variable `message` to `msg` for brevity or to align with a different naming convention (e.g., using shorter variable names).

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in branch `a` is more significant and likely reflects a deeper design change. Therefore, it should be preserved.
   - The change in branch `b` is a minor renaming and can be applied on top of the change from branch `a` without conflict.
   - The final constructor should use `Chooser` as the first parameter (from `a`) and use `msg` as the variable name (from `b`).
