### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

import co.touchlab.researchstack.core.ui.views.StepSwitcher;

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> SceneSwitcher <WITH> StepSwitcher)


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> import co . touchlab . researchstack . core . utils . FormatHelper ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the imports are:
     ```java
     import co.touchlab.researchstack.core.ui.views.SceneSwitcher;
     import co.touchlab.researchstack.core.utils.FormatHelper;
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the `SceneSwitcher` import is replaced with `StepSwitcher`, and the `FormatHelper` import is retained.
   - In branch `b`, the `SceneSwitcher` import is deleted, and the `FormatHelper` import is also deleted.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `SceneSwitcher` with `StepSwitcher`: This suggests a change in UI component usage, possibly to use a newer or different implementation.
     - Retained `FormatHelper`: This indicates that the formatting functionality is still needed.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Removed both `SceneSwitcher` and `FormatHelper`: This suggests a more aggressive cleanup or removal of unused imports.
     - However, removing `FormatHelper` might be unnecessary if it's still used in the codebase.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to update the UI component to use `StepSwitcher` while keeping the formatting utility.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to clean up unused imports, but it might have removed a necessary import (`FormatHelper`) by mistake.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The most logical resolution is to adopt the change from branch `a` (replacing `SceneSwitcher` with `StepSwitcher`) and retain the `FormatHelper` import.
   - The removal of `FormatHelper` in branch `b` is likely incorrect if it's still used elsewhere in the code.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the `FormatHelper` import and switch to `StepSwitcher`.
