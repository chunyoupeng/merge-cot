### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public class BufferedTokenStream<T extends Token> implements TokenStream {
	@NotNull
||||||| base
public class BufferedTokenStream<T extends Token> implements TokenStream {
=======
public class BufferedTokenStream implements TokenStream {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> @ NotNull


## From base to b
<DELETE> < T extends Token >


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the `@NotNull` annotation to the class declaration.
   - **Branch `b`** removed the generic type parameter `<T extends Token>` from the class declaration.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `@NotNull` annotation in `a` likely serves to enforce non-nullability of the `BufferedTokenStream` instance, which is a common practice in null-safe codebases (e.g., using frameworks like JSR 305 or Lombok).
   - The removal of the generic type in `b` suggests that the class no longer needs to be generic, possibly because it was simplified or the generic type was deemed unnecessary for the use case.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to improve code safety and clarity by ensuring the class instance is never null.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to simplify the class by removing unnecessary generic parameters, possibly to reduce complexity or adapt to a new design.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes. The `@NotNull` annotation can be retained to preserve the null-safety guarantee.
   - The removal of the generic type `<T extends Token>` can also be retained if the class no longer needs to be generic.
   - Therefore, the final class should reflect both changes: it should be non-generic and annotated with `@NotNull`.
