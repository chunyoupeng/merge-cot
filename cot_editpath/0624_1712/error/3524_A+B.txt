### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

private static TransactionalDataSource lookupDataSource() {
        if (databaseManager == null) databaseManager = CDI.current().select(DatabaseManager.class).get();
        return databaseManager.getDataSource();

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> private static TransactionalDataSource lookupDataSource ( ) { <newline> if ( databaseManager = = null ) databaseManager = CDI . current ( ) . select ( DatabaseManager . class ) . get ( ) ; <newline> return databaseManager . getDataSource ( ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> throws AplException . NotValidException


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new method `lookupDataSource()` and did not modify the method signature of `getVotedPollsByAccount()`.
   - **Branch `b`** added a `throws AplException.NotValidException` clause to the method signature of `getVotedPollsByAccount()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The addition of `lookupDataSource()` in `a` is likely for internal data source management and does not interfere with the method signature of `getVotedPollsByAccount()`.
   - The addition of `throws AplException.NotValidException` in `b` indicates that the method may now throw a checked exception, which is important for correctness if the method performs validation logic that can fail.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide a utility method for data source lookup, which is likely used elsewhere in the codebase.
   - The intention of `b` is to make the method signature reflect that it can throw a specific exception, which is important for calling code to handle.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `lookupDataSource()` method from `a` is independent and should be kept.
   - The `throws AplException.NotValidException` from `b` is a necessary addition to the method signature to reflect the method's behavior accurately.
   - Since the two changes are orthogonal (one is a new method, the other is a method signature update), they can be merged without conflict.

```java
private static TransactionalDataSource lookupDataSource() {
    if (databaseManager == null) databaseManager = CDI.current().select(DatabaseManager.class).get();
    return databaseManager.getDataSource();
}

public static DbIterator<Poll> getVotedPollsByAccount(long accountId, int from, int to) throws AplException.NotValidException {
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
private static TransactionalDataSource lookupDataSource() {
        if (databaseManager == null) {
            databaseManager = CDI.current().select(DatabaseManager.class).get();
        }
        return databaseManager.getDataSource();
    }

    public static DbIterator<Poll> getVotedPollsByAccount(long accountId, int from, int to) throws AplException.NotValidException {
