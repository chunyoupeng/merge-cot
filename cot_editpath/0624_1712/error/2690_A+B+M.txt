### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> @ NotNull @ NotNull @ NotNull @ NotNull


## From base to b
<ADD> @ NotNull <newline>
<REPLACE> String <WITH> @)
<REPLACE> psuId <WITH> NotNull)
<ADD> SpiPsuData psuData


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Added `@NotNull` annotations to all four parameters: `psuId`, `password`, `businessObject`, and `aspspConsentData`.
     - No structural changes to the method signature beyond adding annotations.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced the first parameter `String psuId` with `@NotNull SpiPsuData psuData`.
     - Added a `@NotNull` annotation to the method itself.
     - The `@NotNull` annotation is likely from a validation framework (e.g., JSR 305 or Lombok).

   The conflict arises because both branches modified the first parameter in incompatible ways:
   - `a` keeps `String psuId` and adds `@NotNull`.
   - `b` replaces `String psuId` with a more complex object `SpiPsuData` and adds `@NotNull`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The addition of `@NotNull` annotations is a defensive programming practice to enforce non-null values at runtime.
     - However, it does not address the potential need for richer PSU data (e.g., additional fields like name, email, etc.).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduces a more robust and extensible data structure (`SpiPsuData`) to represent the PSU.
     - This is a more scalable and maintainable approach, especially if the system requires more PSU-related information in the future.
     - The `@NotNull` annotation on the method is a good addition to enforce that the method must return a non-null result.

   The key difference is that `b` is evolving the data model to use a more complex object, while `a` is focusing on validation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to improve code safety by ensuring that all parameters are non-null at runtime.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to refactor the method to use a more structured and extensible representation of the PSU data.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `b` is more significant and represents a structural improvement to the method signature.
   - The `@NotNull` annotations from `a` can be applied to the new parameters in `b` to retain the validation intent.
   - The `@NotNull` annotation on the method from `b` is a good addition and should be retained.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the structure from `b` and apply the `@NotNull` annotations from `a` to the relevant parameters.

### Gold (Ground Truth)
@NotNull
    default SpiResponse<SpiAuthorisationStatus> authorisePsu(@NotNull SpiPsuData psuData, String password, SpiPeriodicPayment businessObject, AspspConsentData aspspConsentData) {
