### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Completely removed the logic related to checking if the policy is active and scheduling a snapshot.
     - Introduced a new method `getApplyFunction()` that returns a `FI.UnitApply<T>` using `consumer::accept`.
     - This suggests that `a` is refactoring the code to focus on a functional interface and consumer-based logic, possibly decoupling from the snapshot scheduling logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Retained the logic for checking if the policy is active.
     - Modified the snapshot scheduling logic to use a `SnapshotConfig` object obtained from `policyConfig.getSnapshotConfig()`.
     - Changed the interval from `snapshotInterval.getSeconds()` to `snapshotConfig.getInterval()`, indicating a move toward a more flexible or configurable snapshot interval.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The removal of the snapshot logic may be intentional if the feature is no longer needed or is being moved elsewhere.
     - The introduction of `getApplyFunction()` is a clean and functional approach, but it removes the snapshot scheduling logic entirely.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The snapshot logic is improved by making it more modular and configurable via `SnapshotConfig`.
     - This change is likely an enhancement to the existing logic and should be preserved if snapshot scheduling is still relevant.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to refactor the class to use a functional interface (`FI.UnitApply<T>`) and decouple from the snapshot logic.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to enhance the snapshot scheduling logic by making it more flexible and modular.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `getApplyFunction()` method from `a` is a clean and functional addition and should be retained.
   - The snapshot scheduling logic from `b` is an improvement and should be reintegrated into the codebase.
   - The best resolution is to keep both changes: retain the `getApplyFunction()` method from `a` and reintroduce the improved snapshot scheduling logic from `b`.

@Override
public FI.UnitApply<T> getApplyFunction() {
    return consumer::accept;
}

// if the Policy is not "deleted":
if (isPolicyActive()) {
    // schedule the next snapshot:
    final SnapshotConfig snapshotConfig = policyConfig.getSnapshotConfig();
    scheduleSnapshot(snapshotConfig.getInterval());
}
```
