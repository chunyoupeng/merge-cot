### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> " Instructors " , " Instructor3 Course1 " , " Instructor3 Course1 " , " Instructors " , " Instructor3 Course1 " , " Instructor3 Course1 " , " No Response "


## From base to b
<ADD> , Giver ' s Email Recipient ' s Email , instructor1 @ course1 . tmt " , " " , " instructor1 @ course1 . tmt instructor2 @ course1 . tmt " , " instructor2 @ course1 . tmt " , "


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new row for "Instructor3 Course1" with the feedback "No Response".
   - **Branch `b`** added two new email fields: "Giver's Email" and "Recipient's Email" to the header and populated them with email addresses for the existing instructors.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a new feedback entry for a third instructor. This is a straightforward addition and does not interfere with the structure of the CSV.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** adds new columns to the CSV header and populates them with email addresses. This is a structural change that affects the format of the data.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to include additional feedback from a third instructor, which is a natural extension of the existing data.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to enrich the data by including contact information (emails) for both givers and recipients, which could be useful for follow-up or communication purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes from both branches are complementary and do not conflict directly. The addition of the third instructor in `a` can coexist with the addition of email fields in `b`.
   - To resolve the conflict, we should merge both changes:
     - Add the new email columns to the header.
     - Populate the email fields for the existing instructors.
     - Add the new instructor row with the appropriate email fields left empty or filled with "No Response" as appropriate.
   - This ensures that the data remains consistent and that both sets of information are preserved.
