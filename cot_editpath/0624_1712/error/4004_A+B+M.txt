### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

invocationLogger = new InvocationLogger();
        resolverFactory = MultiParameterResolverFactory.ordered(
                new DefaultParameterResolverFactory(),
                new SimpleResourceParameterResolverFactory(invocationLogger));
        testSubject = new AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager(resolverFactory, StubAsyncSaga.class);

eventBus = mock(EventBus.class);

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> eventBus <WITH> invocationLogger)
<REPLACE> mock <WITH> new)
<ADD> InvocationLogger
<REPLACE> EventBus <WITH> ))
<ADD> ; <newline> resolverFactory = MultiParameterResolverFactory
<REPLACE> class <WITH> ordered)
<ADD> ( <newline> new DefaultParameterResolverFactory ( ) , <newline> new SimpleResourceParameterResolverFactory ( invocationLogger ) resolverFactory ,


## From base to b
<DELETE> eventBus = mock ( EventBus . class ) ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the **base**, the code initializes `eventBus` as a mock object and uses it to create an `AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager` with just the `StubAsyncSaga.class`.
   - In **branch a**, the `eventBus` is replaced with an `invocationLogger`, and a `resolverFactory` is introduced. The `AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager` is now initialized with the `resolverFactory` and `StubAsyncSaga.class`.
   - In **branch b**, the `eventBus` and its initialization are completely removed. The `AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager` is still initialized with just `StubAsyncSaga.class`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** introduces a more complex setup by adding an `invocationLogger` and a custom `resolverFactory`. This suggests a need for logging and a more flexible parameter resolution mechanism.
   - **Branch b** simplifies the setup by removing the `eventBus` entirely. This might indicate that the `eventBus` is no longer needed or is being handled elsewhere.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely aims to enhance the test by adding logging and a more sophisticated resolver setup, which could be useful for debugging or testing more complex scenarios.
   - **Branch b** likely aims to simplify the test by removing unnecessary dependencies, possibly because the `eventBus` is no longer relevant or is being injected elsewhere.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since **branch a** introduces a more robust and detailed setup that includes logging and a resolver factory, it is likely more aligned with the goal of testing the `AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager` in a realistic or extended context.
   - **Branch b** removes the `eventBus`, which may not be necessary if the manager no longer depends on it. However, the removal of the `eventBus` without any replacement or explanation could be a simplification that might not be sufficient for comprehensive testing.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to **keep the changes from branch a**, as it provides a more complete and intentional setup for the test.

```java
invocationLogger = new InvocationLogger();
        resolverFactory = MultiParameterResolverFactory.ordered(
                new DefaultParameterResolverFactory(),
                new SimpleResourceParameterResolverFactory(invocationLogger));
        testSubject = new AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager(resolverFactory, StubAsyncSaga.class);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
resolverFactory = MultiParameterResolverFactory.ordered(
                new DefaultParameterResolverFactory(),
                new SimpleResourceParameterResolverFactory(new InvocationLogger()));
        testSubject = new AsyncAnnotatedSagaManager(resolverFactory, StubAsyncSaga.class);
