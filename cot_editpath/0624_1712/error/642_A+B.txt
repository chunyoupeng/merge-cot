### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public CommitInfo commit(boolean addLinks) {
      throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, List<CommentInfo>> comments() {
||||||| base
public Map<String, List<CommentInfo>> comments() {
=======
public Map<String, List<CommentInfo>> comments() throws RestApiException {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> public CommitInfo commit ( boolean addLinks ) { <newline> throw new NotImplementedException ( ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> @ Override <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> throws RestApiException


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new method `commit(boolean addLinks)` that throws a `NotImplementedException`. It also added the `@Override` annotation to the `comments()` method.
   - **Branch `b`** added a `throws RestApiException` clause to the `comments()` method.

   The conflict occurs in the `comments()` method. Both branches made changes to it, but in different ways:
   - `a` added the `@Override` annotation.
   - `b` added the `throws RestApiException` clause.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `@Override` annotation in `a` is likely used to indicate that the `comments()` method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface. This is a good practice for clarity and correctness.
   - The `throws RestApiException` in `b` indicates that the method may throw a checked exception. This is important for correctness if the method implementation in `b` actually throws such an exception.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to clarify that the `comments()` method is an override, which is a good practice for maintainability and readability.
   - The intention of `b` is to declare that the method may throw a `RestApiException`, which is important for the method's correctness and for the caller to handle the exception.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@Override` annotation from `a` should be kept because it improves code clarity and correctness.
   - The `throws RestApiException` from `b` should also be kept because it is necessary for the method's correctness if it throws such an exception.
   - The resolution should combine both changes: include the `@Override` annotation and add the `throws RestApiException` clause to the method signature.

```java
@Override
public Map<String, List<CommentInfo>> comments() throws RestApiException {
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public CommitInfo commit(boolean addLinks) throws RestApiException {
      throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, List<CommentInfo>> comments() throws RestApiException {
