### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have the same content as the base. The base includes a method `conditionalWithNoInfo` and a method `prudent`. The only difference is a minor formatting change in the Javadoc comment in `prudent`, where the `@param x JD` line is missing a space before the asterisk in `a` and `b`. This is the only conflict point.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` have the same content as the base, with only a minor formatting difference in the Javadoc comment. The formatting difference is trivial and does not affect the functionality or correctness of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention behind the formatting change in `a` and `b` is likely to standardize or clean up the Javadoc formatting. However, since both branches have the same formatting, there is no conflict in logic or functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` are identical in terms of code logic and only differ in a trivial formatting detail, the resolution is to keep the formatting as it is in either branch. The Javadoc formatting is not critical to the functionality of the code, so either version is acceptable.
