### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `Proposal` with `ProposalBuilder`.
     - Added method calls like `.replacementString(...)`, `.description(...)`, and `.type(...)`.
     - Changed the return type from `Collection<Proposal>` to `Collection<ProposalBuilder>`.
     - These changes suggest that `ProposalBuilder` is a builder pattern used to construct `Proposal` objects, and the method is now returning a collection of builders instead of the actual proposals.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Replaced `Lists.newArrayList(...)` with `Arrays.asList(...)`.
     - This is a minor change in the way the list is created, but the structure and return type remain the same (`Collection<Proposal>`).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The use of `ProposalBuilder` suggests a shift in design to use a builder pattern for constructing `Proposal` objects. This is a significant architectural change.
     - The method now returns `ProposalBuilder` objects, which may be intended to allow further configuration before building the actual `Proposal`.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The change from `Lists.newArrayList` to `Arrays.asList` is a minor optimization. `Arrays.asList` returns a fixed-size list, while `Lists.newArrayList` returns a modifiable list. Depending on the use case, either could be appropriate.
     - The return type remains `Collection<Proposal>`, so the interface is consistent with the base.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The intention appears to be to refactor the code to use a builder pattern for `Proposal` objects. This could be to allow more flexible or fluent configuration of `Proposal` objects before they are created.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The intention is likely to optimize memory usage or performance by using `Arrays.asList`, which is more lightweight than `Lists.newArrayList`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `a` represent a significant architectural shift, while the changes in `b` are minor and do not conflict with the architectural changes in `a`.
   - Since `a` is introducing a new design pattern (`ProposalBuilder`), it is likely that the intention is to allow more flexible configuration of `Proposal` objects.
   - The `Arrays.asList` change from `b` can be incorporated into `a` without conflict, as it is a minor optimization.
   - Therefore, the resolution should keep the `ProposalBuilder` changes from `a` and incorporate the `Arrays.asList` change from `b`.

# Final Resolution
```java
public Collection<ProposalBuilder> getProposals(TypeDefinition type, AbstractNode node, String prefix) {
    return Arrays.asList( //
            new ProposalBuilder("query").replacementString("query").description(description).type

### Gold (Ground Truth)

        return Arrays.asList( //
                new ProposalBuilder("query").replacementString("query").description(description).type("string"),
                new ProposalBuilder("header").replacementString("header").description(description).type("string"),
                new ProposalBuilder("path").replacementString("path").description(description).type("string"),
                new ProposalBuilder("cookie").replacementString("cookie").description(description).type("string"));
