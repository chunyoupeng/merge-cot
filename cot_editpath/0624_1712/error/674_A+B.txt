### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private Broadcaster<SourceEvent> mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
||||||| base
private Broadcaster<FrequencyChangeEvent> mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
=======
private Broadcaster<FrequencyChangeEvent> mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
    private Broadcaster<Heartbeat> mHeartbeatBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> FrequencyChangeEvent <WITH> SourceEvent)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> private Broadcaster < Heartbeat > mHeartbeatBroadcaster = new Broadcaster < > ( ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the type of `mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster` from `Broadcaster<FrequencyChangeEvent>` to `Broadcaster<SourceEvent>`.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new line for `mHeartbeatBroadcaster` of type `Broadcaster<Heartbeat>`.
   - The conflict arises because both branches modified the same section of the file, but in different ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** This is a type change from `FrequencyChangeEvent` to `SourceEvent`. This likely reflects a refactoring or renaming of the event type. If `SourceEvent` is a valid and intended replacement for `FrequencyChangeEvent`, this change should be preserved.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** This is an addition of a new broadcaster for `Heartbeat` events. This is a new feature or functionality and does not conflict with the change in `a` unless the type `SourceEvent` is incompatible with the rest of the system.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To refactor or rename the event type used in the broadcaster. This could be part of a broader effort to unify or rename event types in the system.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To introduce a new broadcaster for `Heartbeat` events, likely to support a new feature or monitoring functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The type change in `a` should be preserved if `SourceEvent` is the correct replacement for `FrequencyChangeEvent`.
   - The addition in `b` should also be preserved as it introduces a new broadcaster that does not interfere with the type change in `a`.
   - The resolution should combine both changes: update the type of `mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster` to `SourceEvent` and add the new `mHeartbeatBroadcaster` line.

```java
private Broadcaster<SourceEvent> mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
    private Broadcaster<Heartbeat> mHeartbeatBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
private Broadcaster<Heartbeat> mHeartbeatBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
    private Broadcaster<SourceEvent> mFrequencyChangeEventBroadcaster = new Broadcaster<>();
