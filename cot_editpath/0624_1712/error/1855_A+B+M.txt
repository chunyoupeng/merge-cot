### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
throws RDF4JException {
||||||| base
throws OpenRDFException {
=======
throws OpenRDFException
	{
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> OpenRDFException <WITH> RDF4JException)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method declaration ends with `throws OpenRDFException {`.
   - In branch `a`, the exception type `OpenRDFException` is replaced with `RDF4JException`.
   - In branch `b`, a newline is added after `OpenRDFException`, but no other changes are made to the exception type.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** changes the exception type to `RDF4JException`, which is likely a newer or renamed version of `OpenRDFException`. This suggests a migration or update to a newer version of the library.
   - **Branch `b`** adds a newline after the exception declaration, which is a formatting change and does not affect the logic or correctness of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of **branch `a`** is to update the code to use the new exception type, likely to align with a newer version of the RDF4J library.
   - The intention of **branch `b`** is to improve code formatting by adding a newline, which is a minor stylistic change.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in **branch `a`** is more significant and affects the correctness and compatibility of the code with the library being used.
   - The formatting change in **branch `b`** is minor and can be applied on top of the change from `a` without conflict.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the exception type from `a` and apply the formatting change from `b` (i.e., add the newline).
