### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - Branch `a` adds the following imports:
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.SingularityTaskShellCommandRequest;`
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.WebExceptions;`
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.config.UIConfiguration;`
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.config.shell.ShellCommandDescriptor;`
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.config.shell.ShellCommandOptionDescriptor;`
   - Branch `b` adds the following imports:
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.SingularityTransformHelpers;`
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.SingularityUser;`
     - `import com.hubspot.singularity.auth.SingularityAuthorizationHelper;`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches are adding imports that are likely necessary for their respective features.
   - Branch `a` is focused on shell command-related functionality (e.g., `SingularityTaskShellCommandRequest`, `ShellCommandDescriptor`), suggesting it is working on a feature related to executing or managing shell commands.
   - Branch `b` is focused on user-related and authorization functionality (e.g., `SingularityUser`, `SingularityAuthorizationHelper`), suggesting it is working on a feature related to user management or access control.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to support shell command execution or configuration.
   - The intention of `b` is to support user authentication or authorization logic.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of imports are likely needed for the full functionality of the file, the correct resolution is to merge both sets of imports.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in the imports themselves, so no need to discard or modify any.
   - The resolution should include all the imports from both branches.
