### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

public static Type promoteNumeric(final Type from, final boolean decimal, final boolean primitive) {
||||||| base
public static Type promoteNumeric(final Definition definition, final Type from, final boolean decimal, final boolean primitive) {

public static Type promoteNumeric(final Definition definition, final Type from, final boolean decimal) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> final Definition definition ,


## From base to b
<DELETE> , final boolean primitive


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the method signature of `promoteNumeric`.
   - **Branch a** removed the parameter `final Definition definition` from the method signature.
   - **Branch b** removed the parameter `final boolean primitive` from the method signature.
   - The base method signature includes both `Definition definition` and `boolean primitive`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's change:** Removing `Definition definition` suggests that the method no longer requires the `Definition` object to perform its logic. This could indicate a simplification or a refactoring where the `Definition` is no longer used or is derived elsewhere.
   - **Branch b's change:** Removing `boolean primitive` suggests that the method no longer needs to distinguish between primitive and non-primitive types. This could indicate a simplification or a change in the logic where the `primitive` flag is no longer relevant.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a's intention:** To reduce the method's dependency on the `Definition` object, possibly to make the method more self-contained or to remove unused parameters.
   - **Branch b's intention:** To remove the `primitive` flag, possibly because the method no longer needs to handle different behaviors based on whether the type is primitive or not.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches aim to simplify the method by removing parameters that are no longer needed.
   - The final method should reflect the combined simplifications: removing both `Definition definition` and `boolean primitive`.
   - The only remaining parameter is `Type from`, and the `boolean decimal` is retained in both branches.
   - Therefore, the correct merged method signature should be `public static Type promoteNumeric(final Type from, final boolean decimal)`.
