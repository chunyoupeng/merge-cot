### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

public void setAnnotationsPopUpEnabled(boolean value) {
        _annotationsPopUpEnabled = value;
    }
||||||| base

=======
public void setPitchEnabled(boolean value) {
        if (_pitchEnabled == value) { return; }
        _pitchEnabled = value;
        if (_map != null) {
            _map.getUiSettings().setTiltGesturesEnabled(value);
        }
    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two entirely new methods added in branches `a` and `b`.
   - Branch `a` added a method `setAnnotationsPopUpEnabled(boolean value)` that sets a boolean flag `_annotationsPopUpEnabled`.
   - Branch `b` added a method `setPitchEnabled(boolean value)` that sets a flag `_pitchEnabled`, checks for changes, and updates the map's tilt gestures accordingly.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both methods are new and do not overlap in functionality.
   - `setAnnotationsPopUpEnabled` is likely for enabling/disabling an annotation pop-up UI feature.
   - `setPitchEnabled` is for enabling/disabling tilt gestures on a map, with a check to avoid unnecessary updates.
   - Neither method modifies the same variable or logic, so there is no direct conflict in behavior.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to introduce a new UI configuration option for annotations.
   - The intention in `b` is to introduce a new map-related UI configuration option for pitch/tilt gestures.
   - Both changes are additive and serve different purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both methods are new and do not interfere with each other, the best resolution is to merge both methods into the final code.
   - No changes need to be discarded or modified.
   - The final code should include both methods as they are.

```java
public void setAnnotationsPopUpEnabled(boolean value) {
    _annotationsPopUpEnabled = value;
}

public void setPitchEnabled(boolean value) {
    if (_pitchEnabled == value) { return; }
    _pitchEnabled = value;
    if (_map != null) {
        _map.getUiSettings().setTiltGesturesEnabled(value);
    }
}
```

public void setPitchEnabled(boolean value) {
        if (_pitchEnabled == value) { return; }
        _pitchEnabled = value;
        if (_map != null) {
            _map.getUiSettings().setTiltGesturesEnabled(value);
        }
    }

    public void setAnnotationsPopUpEnabled(boolean value) {
        _annotationsPopUpEnabled = value;
    }
