### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@EJB
	private RegionService regionService;
	@EJB
	private DistrictService districtService;
	@EJB
	private EventJurisdictionChecker eventJurisdictionChecker;
||||||| base

=======
@EJB
	private ContactService contactService;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` have added different `@EJB` fields to the same class.
   - Branch `a` added:
     - `RegionService regionService`
     - `DistrictService districtService`
     - `EventJurisdictionChecker eventJurisdictionChecker`
   - Branch `b` added:
     - `ContactService contactService`
   - The base is empty, so there is no original content to compare against.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - All the services (`RegionService`, `DistrictService`, `EventJurisdictionChecker`, and `ContactService`) appear to be valid EJBs that might be used for different functionalities in the class.
   - There is no indication that any of these services are redundant or conflicting in functionality.
   - Since the base is empty, there is no overlap in the same lines being modified, but the conflict is due to both branches adding new lines at the same location in the file.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` likely intends to add services related to region and district management, as well as a checker for event jurisdiction.
   - Branch `b` likely intends to add a service for managing contact-related functionality.
   - The intention of both branches is to enhance the class with additional dependencies, and there is no obvious overlap or conflict in their purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding new dependencies and there is no overlap in the same lines, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes.
   - All four services should be retained in the final code to ensure that the functionality from both branches is preserved.
   - The order of the fields can be preserved as in the original branches, or reordered for consistency if needed.
