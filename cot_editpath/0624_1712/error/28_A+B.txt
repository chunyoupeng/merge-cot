### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Adds three new `MethodHandle` declarations:
       - `IS_MAP`: takes `ScriptObject.class` and `PropertyMap.class` as arguments.
       - `IS_MAP_SCRIPTOBJECT`: takes `Object.class` and `PropertyMap.class`.
       - `IS_INSTANCEOF_2`: takes two `Class` arguments.
     - Deletes the `IS_SCRIPTFUNCTION` and `IS_MAP` (with `Object.class`) from the base.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Adds a new `MethodHandle` `IS_NOT_JSOBJECT`.
     - The edit sequence is incomplete, but it appears to be modifying the `IS_SCRIPTFUNCTION` line or adding a new line after it.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - Introduces a more specific version of `IS_MAP` (`IS_MAP_SCRIPTOBJECT`) that takes `ScriptObject.class` as an argument. This suggests a need for stricter type checking in some contexts.
     - Introduces `IS_INSTANCEOF_2`, which may be for checking if an object is an instance of two classes. This is a more complex check and may be for a specific use case.
     - Removes `IS_SCRIPTFUNCTION` and the original `IS_MAP` (with `Object.class`). This implies that the functionality of these is no longer needed or has been replaced.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Introduces `IS_NOT_JSOBJECT`, which is a logical complement to `IS_SCRIPTOBJECT`. This is a clean and useful addition.
     - The incomplete edit suggests a minor formatting or addition, likely not conflicting with the rest of the logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The intention seems to be to refine the type checking logic by introducing more specific method handles and removing older, less specific ones.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The intention is to add a new method handle (`IS_NOT_JSOBJECT`) to provide a negated version of `IS_SCRIPTOBJECT`, which is a logical and clean addition.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `IS_NOT_JSOBJECT` from branch `b` is a clean and useful addition and should be kept.
   - The `IS_MAP_SCRIPTOBJECT` and `IS_INSTANCEOF_2` from branch `a` are more specific and likely serve a purpose, so they should be kept.
   - The original `IS_MAP` from the base is removed in `a`, but since `IS_MAP_SCRIPTOBJECT` is a more specific
