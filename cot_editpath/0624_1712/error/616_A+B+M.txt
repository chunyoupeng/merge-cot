### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `StringUtils.trimToNull(diffTypes)` with `StringUtil.trimToNull(diffTypes)`.
     - This is a minor change, likely to use a different utility class (`StringUtil` instead of `StringUtils`).
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduced a new logic block that conditionally executes a `formattedDiff` command using `LiquibaseCommand`.
     - Replaced `null` with `schemaComparisons` in the `doDiff` method call.
     - Replaced `System.out` with a `printStream` variable.
     - Added a new `PrintStream` variable and a conditional block for formatted output.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change from `StringUtils` to `StringUtil` is likely a typo or a class name mismatch. If `StringUtil` is not a valid class or is not intended to be used, this change should be reverted. If it's a valid class, it should be checked for correctness.
     - This change is minimal and doesn't affect the overall logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The new logic introduces a conditional execution path for a "formatted diff" feature.
     - This is a significant enhancement that adds functionality.
     - The replacement of `null` with `schemaComparisons` and `System.out` with `printStream` is consistent with the new logic.
     - The new logic is well-structured and introduces a new feature that is likely intended to be kept.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention seems to be to fix or replace a utility class name (`StringUtils` to `StringUtil`), possibly due to a typo or a refactoring.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to add a new feature for formatted diff output, which is a logical and useful enhancement.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The new logic in `b` is a significant and useful addition that should be preserved.
   - The change in `a` (replacing `StringUtils` with `StringUtil`) is likely a mistake or a typo and should be corrected to `StringUtils`.
   - Therefore, the resolution should keep the logic from `b` and revert the `StringUtil` change to `StringUtils`.

# Final Resolution
```java
PrintStream printStream = createPrintStream();
if (isFormattedDiff()) {
    LiquibaseCommand liquibaseCommand = CommandFactory.getInstance().getCommand("formattedDiff");
    DiffCommand diffCommand =
            CommandLineUtils.createDiffCommand(referenceDatabase, db, StringUtils.trimToNull(diffTypes),
                    schemaComparisons, objectChangeFilter, print

### Gold (Ground Truth)
PrintStream printStream = createPrintStream();
            if (isFormattedDiff()) {
                LiquibaseCommand liquibaseCommand = CommandFactory.getInstance().getCommand("formattedDiff");
                DiffCommand diffCommand =
                        CommandLineUtils.createDiffCommand(referenceDatabase, db, StringUtils.trimToNull(diffTypes),
                                schemaComparisons, objectChangeFilter, printStream);
                Map<String, Object> argsMap = new HashMap<>();
                argsMap.put("format", format);
                argsMap.put("diffCommand", diffCommand);
                ((AbstractSelfConfiguratingCommand) liquibaseCommand).configure(argsMap);
                try {
                    liquibaseCommand.execute();
                } catch (CommandExecutionException cee) {
                    throw new LiquibaseException(cee);
                }
            } else {
                CommandLineUtils.doDiff(referenceDatabase, db, StringUtil.trimToNull(diffTypes), schemaComparisons, objectChangeFilter, printStream);
            }
