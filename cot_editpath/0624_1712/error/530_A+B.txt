### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> GraphFieldSchemaContainerVersion < ? , ? , ? , ? , ? > fromVersion ,
<DELETE> , <newline> List < Tuple < String , List < Tuple < String , Object > > > > migrationScripts


## From base to b
<REPLACE> SearchQueueBatch <WITH> EventQueueBatch)
<DELETE> , <newline> SchemaContainerVersion toVersion Branch branch ,


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Added a new parameter `GraphFieldSchemaContainerVersion<?, ?, ?, ?, ?> fromVersion`.
     - Removed the parameter `List<Tuple<String, List<Tuple<String, Object>>>> migrationScripts`.
     - Added a new parameter `SchemaContainerVersion toVersion`.
     - Added a new parameter `Branch branch`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Replaced `SearchQueueBatch` with `EventQueueBatch`.
     - Removed the parameter `SchemaContainerVersion toVersion`.
     - Removed the parameter `Branch branch`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The addition of `fromVersion` and `toVersion` suggests a more detailed versioning mechanism for migration logic.
     - The removal of `migrationScripts` implies that the migration logic is now handled differently, possibly integrated into the versioning system.
     - The addition of `Branch branch` indicates that the migration logic now depends on the branch context.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The replacement of `SearchQueueBatch` with `EventQueueBatch` suggests a change in the queueing mechanism used for processing.
     - The removal of `toVersion` and `Branch branch` implies that the migration logic in this branch does not require these parameters, possibly because it is simpler or uses a different approach.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** is likely enhancing the migration logic to support more detailed versioning and branch-aware operations.
   - **Branch b** is likely simplifying the migration logic and adapting it to a different queueing system.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `fromVersion` and `toVersion` parameters are essential for version-aware migration logic and should be retained.
   - The `Branch branch` parameter is also important if the migration logic is branch-dependent.
   - The replacement of `SearchQueueBatch` with `EventQueueBatch` is a meaningful change that should be incorporated.
   - The `migrationScripts` parameter is removed in branch a, which suggests that it is no longer needed if the versioning system is handling the migration logic.

   Therefore, the final resolution should include the `fromVersion` and `toVersion` parameters, the `Branch branch` parameter, and the use of `EventQueueBatch` instead of `SearchQueueBatch`.

# Final resolution
```java
private void migrateContainer(NodeMigrationActionContextImpl ac, EventQueueBatch batch, NodeGraphFieldContainer container,
		GraphFieldSchemaContainerVersion<?, ?, ?, ?, ?> fromVersion, SchemaContainerVersion toVersion, Branch branch, SchemaModel newSchema, List<Exception> errorsDetected,
		Set<String> touchedFields) {
```
