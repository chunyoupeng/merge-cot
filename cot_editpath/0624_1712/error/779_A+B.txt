### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
.addBeans(MockBean.of(mock(TransactionVersionValidator.class), TransactionVersionValidator.class))
||||||| base

=======
.addBeans(MockBean.of(generatorService, GeneratorService.class))
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a single line of code where both branches `a` and `b` have added different `.addBeans(...)` calls.
   - Branch `a` added: `.addBeans(MockBean.of(mock(TransactionVersionValidator.class), TransactionVersionValidator.class))`
   - Branch `b` added: `.addBeans(MockBean.of(generatorService, GeneratorService.class))`
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own `.addBeans(...)` line.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is adding a mock bean for `TransactionVersionValidator`. This is likely for testing purposes, where the real implementation is replaced with a mock to isolate behavior.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding a real bean (`generatorService`) for `GeneratorService`. This is likely for injecting a real implementation into the test context.
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. There is no direct overlap or contradiction between the two beans.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to mock a dependency (`TransactionVersionValidator`) to ensure test isolation.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to inject a real service (`generatorService`) to simulate real behavior in the test context.
   - The intentions are complementary, not conflicting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both beans are needed for different purposes and do not interfere with each other, both should be included in the final code.
   - The correct resolution is to combine both `.addBeans(...)` calls in the merged code.

.addBeans(MockBean.of(mock(TransactionVersionValidator.class), TransactionVersionValidator.class))
.addBeans(MockBean.of(generatorService, GeneratorService.class))

.addBeans(MockBean.of(generatorService, GeneratorService.class))
        .addBeans(MockBean.of(mock(TransactionVersionValidator.class), TransactionVersionValidator.class))
