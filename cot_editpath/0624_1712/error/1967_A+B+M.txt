### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> authMechanismImpl ; <newline> private final Map < String , Object > authMechanismArgs ; <newline> private final String


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is centered around the addition of two new fields in `b`:
     - `private final String authMechanismImpl;`
     - `private final Map<String, Object> authMechanismArgs;`
   - In `a`, there are no changes to the base code in this section.
   - The base code already includes `idmImpl`, `idmArgs`, `amImpl`, and `amArgs`, which are similar in structure to the new fields in `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** made no changes in this section, so there is no conflict to resolve from its side.
   - **Branch `b`** added two new fields to support an authentication mechanism implementation and its arguments. This suggests an intention to introduce a new authentication mechanism configuration into the system.
   - The new fields in `b` are logically consistent with the existing fields like `idmImpl` and `amImpl`, which are also configuration fields for different components.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to leave the configuration as is.
   - The intention of `b` is to extend the configuration to include a new authentication mechanism, likely to support a new feature or integration.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` made no changes, the only conflict is from `b`'s addition.
   - The addition in `b` is logical and consistent with the existing code structure.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to **keep the new fields from `b`
