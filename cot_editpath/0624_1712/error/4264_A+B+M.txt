### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import com.stratio.meta2.common.data.TableName;
import com.stratio.meta2.common.statements.structures.selectors.SelectExpression;
||||||| base

=======
import com.stratio.meta2.common.data.TableName;
import com.stratio.meta2.common.statements.structures.terms.Term;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> import com . stratio . meta2 . common . data . TableName ; <newline>
<REPLACE> terms <WITH> selectors)
<REPLACE> Term <WITH> SelectExpression)


## From base to b
<ADD> import com . stratio . meta2 . common . data . TableName ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, the code includes an import for `Term`.
   - In branch `a`, the import for `Term` is replaced with `SelectExpression`, and the word `terms` is replaced with `selectors`.
   - In branch `b`, the import for `TableName` is added, but the import for `Term` remains unchanged.
   - The conflict is in the import section and the usage of `Term` vs. `SelectExpression`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` is moving away from using `Term` and instead using `SelectExpression`, which suggests a shift in the logic or API being used.
   - Branch `b` is adding an import for `TableName`, which is likely a new dependency or usage in the code.
   - The import for `Term` is still present in `b`, but it is removed in `a` in favor of `SelectExpression`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` is likely refactoring the code to use a new API or structure involving `SelectExpression` and `selectors`, which may be more appropriate for the current logic.
   - Branch `b` is likely adding a new dependency (`TableName`) without changing the existing logic involving `Term`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The import for `TableName` is needed in both branches, so it should be included.
   - The import for `Term` is removed in `a` and replaced with `SelectExpression`, which suggests that `SelectExpression` is the correct type to use.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the import for `TableName` and use `SelectExpression` instead of `Term`.
