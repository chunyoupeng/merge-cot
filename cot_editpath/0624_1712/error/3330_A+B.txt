### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> ON_UPDATE_FILE ( 32789 , " OnUpdateFile " ) , <newline> ON_UPDATE_SUB_MENU ( 32790 , " OnUpdateSubMenu " ) , <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a:** Removed all content from the base.
   - **Branch b:** Added two new entries at the top: `ON_UPDATE_FILE` and `ON_UPDATE_SUB_MENU`, and then preserved the rest of the base content, including the deprecated entries.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a:** The removal of all content is extreme and likely unintentional or a mistake. It discards all existing functionality and definitions.
   - **Branch b:** The addition of two new entries is a logical and minimal change. It introduces new functionality while preserving the existing structure and deprecated entries.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a:** The intention is unclear. Removing all content is not a typical or safe operation and likely represents an error or misoperation.
   - **Branch b:** The intention is to extend the list of constants with new functionality (`ON_UPDATE_FILE` and `ON_UPDATE_SUB_MENU`) while keeping the rest of the existing definitions intact.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch a's change is to remove all content, it is not viable to keep it.
   - Branch b's change is to add new functionality while preserving the rest, which is a safe and logical operation.
   - Therefore, the resolution should be to keep the additions from branch b and discard the destructive change from branch a.
