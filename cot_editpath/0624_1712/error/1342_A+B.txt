### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

import static org.opengis.annotation.Obligation.OPTIONAL;

||||||| base

// Branch-dependent imports
import org.apache.sis.internal.jdk8.BiConsumer;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - **Branch `a`** added three static imports:
     - `import static org.opengis.annotation.Obligation.OPTIONAL;`
     - `import static org.opengis.annotation.Obligation.MANDATORY;`
     - `import static org.opengis.annotation.Specification.ISO_19115;`
   - **Branch `b`** added a non-static import:
     - `import org.apache.sis.internal.jdk8.BiConsumer;`
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own imports.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes** are related to static imports for constants used in annotations. These are likely used in the code for marking fields or methods with metadata (e.g., `@Obligation(OPTIONAL)`).
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is for a utility class (`BiConsumer`) that may be used in functional programming constructs or for compatibility with Java 8 features.
   - Both sets of imports are likely necessary for their respective features and do not conflict with each other.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely adding support for OpenGIS annotations, which are used in geospatial metadata standards.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely adding support for Java 8 functional interfaces or backports for compatibility or new functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of imports are independent and serve different purposes, they can be merged without conflict.
   - The correct resolution is to include all the imports from both branches in the final file.
   - No changes are needed to the import statements themselves, and no logic is involved in the conflict.
