### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public Object onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance() {
        return mInstanceUploaderTask;
||||||| base
public Object onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() {
        return mInstanceUploaderTask;
=======
public Object onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() {
        return instanceUploaderTask;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> onRetainNonConfigurationInstance <WITH> onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> mInstanceUploaderTask <WITH> instanceUploaderTask)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method is named `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()` and returns `mInstanceUploaderTask`.
   - In branch `a`, the method name is changed to `onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance()`, but the return value remains `mInstanceUploaderTask`.
   - In branch `b`, the method name remains `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()`, but the return value is changed from `mInstanceUploaderTask` to `instanceUploaderTask`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** The method name is changed to `onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance()`. This suggests an intention to customize or differentiate the behavior of this method from the standard `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()`. This is a valid change if the method is meant to serve a specific purpose different from the standard Android lifecycle method.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The return value is changed from `mInstanceUploaderTask` to `instanceUploaderTask`. This implies that the variable was renamed, likely to follow a different naming convention or to reflect a change in the variable's scope or ownership (e.g., from a class field to a local variable or a different naming style).

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to rename the method to indicate a custom or specialized version of the standard Android lifecycle method. This could be to avoid confusion with the standard method or to provide a more descriptive name.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to rename the variable `mInstanceUploaderTask` to `instanceUploaderTask`. This could be part of a broader code cleanup or refactoring to remove the `m` prefix (common in Android for private fields) or to indicate a change in the variable's scope or usage.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The method name change in `a` is likely to improve clarity or specificity, while the variable name change in `b` is likely part of a naming convention update.
   - To resolve the conflict, we should combine both changes: use the new method name from `a` and the new variable name from `b`.
   - The final method should be named `onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance()` and return `instanceUploaderTask`.
