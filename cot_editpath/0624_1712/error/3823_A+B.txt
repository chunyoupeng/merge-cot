### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

@Test
  public void testWhiteSpaceOnly() throws IOException {
    final ResourcePostProcessor processor = new GoogleClosureCompressorProcessor(CompilationLevel.WHITESPACE_ONLY);
    final URL url = getClass().getResource("google");

    final File testFolder = new File(url.getFile(), "test");
    final File expectedFolder = new File(url.getFile(), "expectedWhitespaceOnly");
    WroTestUtils.compareFromDifferentFoldersByExtension(testFolder, expectedFolder, "js",

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have completely different content compared to the base (which is empty).
   - Branch `a` introduces a test method `testWhiteSpaceOnly()` that sets up a `GoogleClosureCompressorProcessor` with `WHITESPACE_ONLY` compression and compares the output of a test folder with an expected folder.
   - Branch `b` introduces setup and teardown methods (`@Before` and `@After`) that configure and clean up the `Context` for the test environment.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The test method in `a` is a concrete test case that validates the behavior of the `GoogleClosureCompressorProcessor` with a specific configuration.
   - The setup and teardown in `b` are essential for ensuring that the test environment is properly initialized and cleaned up, which is a best practice in unit testing.
   - Neither branch includes the content of the other, so the conflict is not about overlapping lines but about combining two distinct additions.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to add a specific test case for whitespace-only compression.
   - The intention of `b` is to ensure the test environment is properly set up and torn down, which is a prerequisite for reliable test execution.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The setup and teardown methods from `b` should be included before the test method from `a` to ensure the test runs in a properly configured environment.
   - The test method from `a` should be retained as it provides a specific test case.
   - The resolution should combine both changes in a way that maintains the logical flow of the test class.
