### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

@Nullable final ByteBuffer bytePayload,
            @Nullable final Adaptable originatingAdaptable) {
||||||| base
@Nullable final ByteBuffer bytePayload) {

@Nullable final ByteBuffer bytePayload,
            @Nullable final AuthorizationContext authorizationContext) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , <newline> @ Nullable final Adaptable originatingAdaptable


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> @ Nullable final AuthorizationContext authorizationContext


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method signature ends with `@Nullable final ByteBuffer bytePayload)`.
   - In branch `a`, a new parameter `@Nullable final Adaptable originatingAdaptable` is added.
   - In branch `b`, a new parameter `@Nullable final AuthorizationContext authorizationContext` is added.
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new parameter to the same position in the method signature.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are additive and do not directly interfere with each other.
   - The parameter `originatingAdaptable` likely provides contextual information about the source of the data or event.
   - The parameter `authorizationContext` likely provides security or access control information.
   - Both parameters are optional (`@Nullable`), so their absence in the base code suggests they are not required for the method to function.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to enrich the method with additional contextual information about the originating adaptable object.
   - The intention of `b` is to add security-related context for authorization checks.
   - These intentions are orthogonal and complementary, not conflicting.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both parameters are optional and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to include both in the final method signature.
   - The order of the parameters should follow a logical grouping: `bytePayload` (core data), followed by `originatingAdaptable` (context), and then `authorizationContext` (security).
   - This maintains clarity and consistency in the method's parameter list.

# Final resolution
```java
@Nullable final ByteBuffer bytePayload,
            @Nullable final Adaptable originatingAdaptable,
            @Nullable final AuthorizationContext authorizationContext) {
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
