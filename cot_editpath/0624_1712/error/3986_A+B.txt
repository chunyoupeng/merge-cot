### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import lucee.runtime.engine.ThreadLocalPageContext;
||||||| base
import lucee.runtime.exp.ApplicationException;
=======
import lucee.runtime.exp.ApplicationException;
import lucee.runtime.exp.FunctionException;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> exp <WITH> engine)
<REPLACE> ApplicationException <WITH> ThreadLocalPageContext)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> import lucee . runtime . exp . FunctionException ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base code originally had:
     ```java
     import lucee.runtime.exp.ApplicationException;
     ```
   - Branch `a` removed `ApplicationException` and added `ThreadLocalPageContext`.
   - Branch `b` added `FunctionException` on a new line, keeping `ApplicationException`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed `ApplicationException` and replaced it with `ThreadLocalPageContext`.
     - This suggests that `a` is refactoring or updating the code to use a different class, possibly for a specific feature or optimization.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added `FunctionException` without removing `ApplicationException`.
     - This implies that `b` is introducing a new exception type for additional functionality or error handling.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to replace or phase out the use of `ApplicationException` in favor of `ThreadLocalPageContext`, which might be a more appropriate or updated class for the current use case.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to expand the error-handling capabilities by including `FunctionException`, which is a new or additional exception type.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` is removing `ApplicationException` and replacing it with `ThreadLocalPageContext`, and `b` is adding `FunctionException`, the best resolution is to include both `ThreadLocalPageContext` and `FunctionException`.
   - This preserves the intent of both branches: `a`'s refactoring and `b`'s enhancement.
   - The base `ApplicationException` is removed in `a`, so it should not be reintroduced unless necessary, but in this case, it's not needed since `a` is moving away from it.

# Final Resolution
```java
import lucee.runtime.engine.ThreadLocalPageContext;
import lucee.runtime.exp.FunctionException;
```
