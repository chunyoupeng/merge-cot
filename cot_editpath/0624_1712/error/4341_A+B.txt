### Prompt

You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

public boolean isFlowsInherited() {

    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two sets of code that both add new methods to a class.
   - `a` added two methods: `isFlowsInherited()` and `setFlowsInherited(boolean flowsInherited)`, which are getter and setter for a boolean field `flowsInherited`.
   - `b` added two methods: `getPostLogoutRedirectUris()` and `setPostLogoutRedirectUris(List<String> postLogoutRedirectUris)`, which are getter and setter for a list field `postLogoutRedirectUris`.
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own methods.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of changes are valid and likely represent separate features or configurations.
   - `a`'s methods suggest a feature related to whether certain "flows" are inherited, possibly in a configuration or workflow system.
   - `b`'s methods suggest a feature related to redirect URIs after logout, likely in an authentication or OAuth context.
   - Neither set of methods overlaps with the other in terms of functionality or field names.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to add a configuration flag (`flowsInherited`) to the class.
   - The intention of `b` is to add a list of redirect URIs (`postLogoutRedirectUris`) to the class.
   - Both changes are additive and do not interfere with each other.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of methods are independent and do not conflict with each other, the correct resolution is to merge both sets of methods into the final code.
   - No changes need to be discarded or modified.
   - The final class should include both the `flowsInherited` and `postLogoutRedirectUris` fields and their respective getters and setters.

```java
public boolean isFlowsInherited() {
    return flowsInherited;
}

public void setFlowsInherited(boolean flowsInherited) {
    this.flowsInherited = flowsInherited;
}

public List<String> getPostLogoutRedirectUris() {
    return postLogoutRedirectUris;
}

public void setPostLogoutRedirectUris(List<String> postLogoutRedirectUris) {
    this.postLogoutRedirectUris = postLogoutRedirectUris;
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public List<String> getPostLogoutRedirectUris() {
        return postLogoutRedirectUris;
    }

    public void setPostLogoutRedirectUris(List<String> postLogoutRedirectUris) {
        this.postLogoutRedirectUris = postLogoutRedirectUris;
    }

    public boolean isFlowsInherited() {
        return flowsInherited;
    }

    public void setFlowsInherited(boolean flowsInherited) {
        this.flowsInherited = flowsInherited;
    }
