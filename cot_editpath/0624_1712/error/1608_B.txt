### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
BBC.TOOL_RANGE_ERROR.send(player, config.maxSuperPickaxeSize);
||||||| base
player.printError("Maximum range: " + config.maxSuperPickaxeSize);
=======
player.printError(TranslatableComponent.of("worldedit.superpickaxe.max-range", TextComponent.of(config.maxSuperPickaxeSize)));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> BBC . TOOL_RANGE_ERROR . send (
<REPLACE> . <WITH> ,)
<DELETE> printError ( " Maximum range : " +


## From base to b
<ADD> TranslatableComponent . of (
<REPLACE> Maximum <WITH> worldedit)
<ADD> . superpickaxe . max -
<DELETE> :
<REPLACE> + <WITH> ,)
<ADD> TextComponent . of ( ) )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the `printError` call with a call to `BBC.TOOL_RANGE_ERROR.send(...)`, which appears to be a custom error message system.
     - Removed the string `"Maximum range: "` and replaced `+` with `,` to pass the parameter.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced the `printError` call with a `TranslatableComponent.of(...)` call, which suggests internationalization (i18n) support.
     - Changed `"Maximum"` to `"worldedit.superpickaxe.max-range"` to use a key for translation.
     - Used `TextComponent.of(...)` to wrap the value for display.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The use of `BBC.TOOL_RANGE_ERROR.send(...)` suggests a centralized error-handling mechanism, which is good for maintainability and consistency.
     - However, it does not support internationalization, which is a drawback in a multilingual application.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The use of `TranslatableComponent.of(...)` and `TextComponent.of(...)` supports internationalization, which is essential for user-facing messages.
     - This approach is more flexible and future-proof if the application needs to support multiple languages.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to centralize error messages and improve code maintainability by using a predefined error system.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to make the message translatable, which is a common requirement in modern applications.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best approach is to combine the intentions of both branches.
   - Use the centralized error message system (`BBC.TOOL_RANGE_ERROR.send(...)`) from branch `a` for maintainability.
   - Integrate the internationalization support from branch `b` by using `TranslatableComponent.of(...)` and `TextComponent.of(...)` to ensure the message is translatable.
   - This way, the message is both centralized and internationalized, fulfilling both goals.

```java
BBC.TOOL_RANGE_ERROR.send(player, TranslatableComponent.of("worldedit.superpickaxe.max-range", TextComponent.of(config.maxSuperPickaxeSize)));
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
player.printError(TranslatableComponent.of("worldedit.superpickaxe.max-range", TextComponent.of(config.maxSuperPickaxeSize)));
