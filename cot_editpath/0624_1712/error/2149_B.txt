### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different methods added by branches `a` and `b`.
   - Branch `a` added a method `showMessage(String message)` that uses `UiUtil.showMessage()` to display a message on the UI.
   - Branch `b` added a method `hideSoftKeypad()` and a more complex broadcast-based message system (`sendBroadcastFlyingMessage`, `showFlyingMessageReceiver`) for showing messages across activities.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s method** is a simple UI message display method. It is straightforward and suitable for showing messages within the current activity.
   - **Branch `b`'s methods** are more complex and provide a broadcast-based mechanism for showing messages across multiple activities. This is useful for a more decoupled architecture where messages can be shown from any activity.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to provide a quick and simple way to show messages within the current UI context.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to provide a more scalable and reusable message system that works across multiple activities.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both methods serve different purposes and are not mutually exclusive.
   - The `showMessage` method from `a` is useful for local message display.
   - The broadcast-based system from `b` is useful for global message display.
   - Therefore, both should be kept, but the `showMessage` method from `a` should be modified to avoid duplication with the `showMessage` method in `b`'s `onReceive` method.
   - We will rename the method from `a` to `showLocalMessage` to distinguish it from the broadcast-based message system.
