### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> new ClientSessionChannel . MessageListener ) { <newline> @ Override <newline> public void onMessage ( ClientSessionChannel Message
<ADD> - >
<DELETE> <newline> }


## From base to b
<REPLACE> System <WITH> logger)
<REPLACE> err <WITH> info)
<DELETE> . println
<ADD> { } @ { }
<REPLACE> + <WITH> ,)
<REPLACE> + <WITH> ,)
<DELETE> " @ " +


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed the implementation of `MessageListener` from an anonymous class to a lambda expression. It removed the anonymous class syntax (`new ClientSessionChannel.MessageListener() { ... }`) and replaced it with a lambda (`(channel, message) -> { ... }`). The body of the method remains the same: it prints to `System.err` and calls `publishLatch.countDown()`.
   - **Branch `b`** changed the logging mechanism from `System.err.println` to a `logger.info` call. It also updated the string formatting from concatenation (`+`) to a parameterized format (`{}`), and removed the explicit string concatenation for the message and channel.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change (lambda expression):** This is a modern Java best practice for functional interfaces. It improves readability and reduces boilerplate code. The behavior of the code remains the same in terms of output and logic.
   - **Branch `b`'s change (logging with logger):** This is a significant improvement in terms of logging best practices. Using a logger instead of `System.err.println` is more flexible and scalable. The use of parameterized logging (`{}`) is also more efficient and preferred in production code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To modernize the code by using a lambda expression, which is more concise and idiomatic in Java 8+.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To improve the logging mechanism by using a proper logger and better formatting, which is more suitable for production environments.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are beneficial and orthogonal. The lambda expression from `a` is a syntactic improvement, and the logging change from `b` is a functional improvement.
   - The best resolution is to combine both changes: use the lambda expression from `a` and apply the improved logging from `b`.
   - This results in a concise, modern, and production-ready implementation.

# Final Resolution

```java
ClientSessionChannel.MessageListener subscriber = (channel, message) -> {
    logger.info(" < {} @ {}", message, channel);
    publishLatch.countDown();
};
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
ClientSessionChannel.MessageListener subscriber = (channel, message) -> {
            logger.info(" < {} @ {}", message, channel);
            publishLatch.countDown();
