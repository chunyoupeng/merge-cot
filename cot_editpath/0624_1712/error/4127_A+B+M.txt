### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> / * * <newline> * Run a zip synchronously . <newline> * @ param < S > Type of data produced . <newline> * @ return An IDataSet containing the final result of the zip . <newline> * / <newline> @ NonNull


## From base to b
<REPLACE> NonNull <WITH> Nonnull)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a full Javadoc comment and added the `@NonNull` annotation to the method.
   - **Branch `b`** changed the annotation from `@NonNull` to `@Nonnull` (lowercase 'n').

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** improves documentation by adding a Javadoc comment, which is good practice for API clarity. It also adds `@NonNull`, which is a common annotation used in Java for nullability checks.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** modifies the annotation name from `@NonNull` to `@Nonnull`. This could be due to a different annotation library being used (e.g., `javax.annotation.Nonnull` vs `org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull`), or it could be a typo or stylistic choice.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intended to improve clarity and correctness by documenting the method and enforcing nullability.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intended to align with a specific annotation style or library, or it may have been a typo.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The Javadoc added by `a` should be kept, as it improves documentation.
   - The `@NonNull` annotation from `a` is more standard in many Java projects than `@Nonnull`, so it should be retained unless there is a strong reason to use `@Nonnull`.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the Javadoc from `a` and the `@NonNull` annotation, and discard the `@Nonnull` change from `b`.
