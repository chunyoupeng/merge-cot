### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> PisConsentType <WITH> PisPaymentService)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> pis <WITH> ConsentStatus)
<DELETE> . PisConsentStatus


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, the imports are:
     ```java
     import de.adorsys.aspsp.xs2a.consent.api.pis.PisConsentStatus;
     import de.adorsys.aspsp.xs2a.consent.api.pis.PisConsentType;
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the second import is changed from `PisConsentType` to `PisPaymentService`.
   - In branch `b`, the first import (`PisConsentStatus`) is removed, and the second import is changed from `PisConsentType` to `ConsentStatus`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces `PisPaymentService`, which suggests a shift in the API structure or naming convention, possibly to align with a new service or naming standard.
   - **Branch `b`** removes `PisConsentStatus` and replaces `PisConsentType` with `ConsentStatus`, which could indicate a broader refactor to consolidate or rename consent-related types.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to update the code to use a more specific or newly introduced service (`PisPaymentService`) instead of a type (`PisConsentType`).
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to simplify or unify the consent-related types by removing a redundant or obsolete import (`PisConsentStatus`) and replacing `PisConsentType` with a more general or consolidated type (`ConsentStatus`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches are making significant changes to the import structure, but they are not compatible with each other.
   - If the goal is to retain the most updated or consolidated naming, `ConsentStatus` from branch `b` seems to be the more general and likely preferred term.
   - However, if the intention is to use a more specific service (`PisPaymentService`), that should be retained.
   - A reasonable resolution is to retain `ConsentStatus` from branch `b` and remove the `PisConsentStatus` import, while also removing the `PisPaymentService` import since it is not compatible with the broader refactor implied by branch `b`.

   Therefore, the final resolution is to adopt the imports from branch `b`, as they suggest a more consolidated and likely future-proof naming convention.
