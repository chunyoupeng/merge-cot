### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> *
<DELETE> <newline> *



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the Javadoc comment for the method includes a description of the method's purpose and two parameters: `operation` and `result`.
   - In branch `a`, the line `* Updates the view...` is modified by adding an extra `*` at the beginning of the line and inserting a newline before it. This suggests a formatting change, possibly to align the comment with a specific style.
   - In branch `b`, the line `* Updates the view...` is modified by removing the extra space before the word "file" and shortening the parameter descriptions (e.g., "Removal operation performed." becomes "Removal operation performed." but with less spacing). This suggests a cleanup of the Javadoc formatting for brevity and consistency.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` adds an extra `*` and newline, which may be an attempt to align the Javadoc with a specific style or formatting rule. However, this could be unnecessary or inconsistent with the rest of the codebase.
   - The change in `b` removes unnecessary spacing and shortens the parameter descriptions, which improves readability and aligns with common Javadoc formatting practices.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` appears to be to adjust the formatting of the Javadoc comment, possibly to match a specific style guide or to fix a minor formatting issue.
   - The intention in `b` is to clean up the Javadoc formatting, making it more concise and readable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `b` is more aligned with standard Javadoc formatting and improves readability without introducing unnecessary complexity.
   - The change in `a` introduces an extra `*` and newline, which may not be necessary and could be considered a formatting inconsistency.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the formatting from `b` as it is cleaner and more consistent with typical Javadoc conventions.
