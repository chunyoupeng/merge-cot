### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (_outputContext.writeFieldName(fieldName) == JsonWriteContext.STATUS_EXPECT_VALUE) {
||||||| base
if (_writeContext.writeFieldName(fieldName) == JsonWriteContext.STATUS_EXPECT_VALUE) {
=======
if (_cborContext.writeFieldName(fieldName) == CBORWriteContext.STATUS_EXPECT_VALUE) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> _writeContext <WITH> _outputContext)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> _writeContext <WITH> _cborContext)
<REPLACE> JsonWriteContext <WITH> CBORWriteContext)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     if (_writeContext.writeFieldName(fieldName) == JsonWriteContext.STATUS_EXPECT_VALUE) {
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is:
     ```java
     if (_outputContext.writeFieldName(fieldName) == JsonWriteContext.STATUS_EXPECT_VALUE) {
     ```
     - Change: `_writeContext` is replaced with `_outputContext`.
   - In branch `b`, the line is:
     ```java
     if (_cborContext.writeFieldName(fieldName) == CBORWriteContext.STATUS_EXPECT_VALUE) {
     ```
     - Changes:
       - `_writeContext` is replaced with `_cborContext`.
       - `JsonWriteContext` is replaced with `CBORWriteContext`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaces `_writeContext` with `_outputContext`.
     - This suggests a shift from a general write context to a specific output context, possibly for JSON.
     - No change to the `JsonWriteContext` class name, implying the logic is still JSON-specific.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaces `_writeContext` with `_cborContext`, and `JsonWriteContext` with `CBORWriteContext`.
     - This suggests a shift to CBOR-specific logic, indicating a different serialization format.
     - The change is more comprehensive, affecting both the context variable and the class name.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to refine the JSON serialization logic by using a more specific context (`_outputContext`) while keeping the JSON format.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to switch the logic entirely to CBOR format, using a CBOR-specific context and class.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two branches are modifying the same line for different purposes:
     - `a` is about refining JSON serialization.
     - `b` is about switching to CBOR.
   - Since the two branches are targeting different formats (JSON vs. CBOR), they are likely for different use cases or features.
   - The correct resolution is to **combine both changes**, assuming the codebase supports both JSON and CBOR formats and the context variables (`_outputContext` and `_cborContext`) are valid and distinct.
   - Therefore, the merged line should reflect both changes: using `_outputContext` and `JsonWriteContext` for JSON, and `_cborContext` and `CBORWriteContext` for CBOR.
