### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
catch (final URISyntaxException e1) {
				LogUtils.warn(e1);
				UITools.errorMessage("wrong URI " + inputValue);
||||||| base
catch (URISyntaxException e1) {
				LogTool.warn(e1);
				UITools.errorMessage("wrong URI " + inputValue);
=======
catch (final URISyntaxException e1) {
				LogTool.warn(e1);
				UITools.errorMessage(FpStringUtils.format("invalid_uri", inputValue));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> final
<REPLACE> LogTool <WITH> LogUtils)


## From base to b
<ADD> final FpStringUtils . format (
<REPLACE> wrong <WITH> invalid_uri)
<DELETE> URI
<REPLACE> + <WITH> ,)
<ADD> )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Adds the `final` keyword to the exception parameter `e1`.
     - Replaces `LogTool.warn(e1)` with `LogUtils.warn(e1)`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Adds the `final` keyword to the exception parameter `e1`.
     - Replaces `LogTool.warn(e1)` with `LogUtils.warn(e1)` (indirectly, by using `FpStringUtils.format`).
     - Replaces the hardcoded string `"wrong URI "` with a localized message using `FpStringUtils.format("invalid_uri", inputValue)`.

   The conflict occurs in the `catch` block for `URISyntaxException`, where both branches have modified the same lines in different ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **`final` keyword:** Both branches add `final` to the exception parameter `e1`. This is a common Java best practice to prevent accidental reassignment and improve code clarity. This change should be kept.
   - **`LogTool.warn(e1)` to `LogUtils.warn(e1)`:** Branch `a` makes this change directly, while branch `b` implies it through the use of `FpStringUtils.format`. It seems like both branches are moving toward using a more consistent or updated logging utility. This change should be kept.
   - **Hardcoded string to localized message:** Branch `b` replaces the hardcoded string `"wrong URI "` with a localized message using `FpStringUtils.format("invalid_uri", inputValue)`. This is a significant improvement for internationalization and maintainability. This change should be kept.
   - **Branch `a` keeps the hardcoded string:** This is less ideal compared to the localized message in branch `b`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention appears to be improving code quality by using `final` and updating the logging utility to `LogUtils`. However, it does not address the hardcoded string, which is a missed opportunity for internationalization.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to improve both code quality and internationalization by using `final`, updating the logging utility, and replacing the hardcoded string with a localized message.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best resolution is to adopt the changes from branch `b`, as it includes all the improvements from branch `a` (adding `final` and using `LogUtils`) and adds the important enhancement of using a localized message.
   - The only conflict is the hardcoded string in branch `a`, which should be replaced with the localized message from branch `b`.
