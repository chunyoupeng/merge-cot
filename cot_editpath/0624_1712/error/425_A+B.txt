### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

        static final String TENANT_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT = "tenant_discovery_endpoint";
    }

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In branch `a`, two new static nested classes are added: `InstanceDiscoveryClaim` and `TenantDiscoveryClaim`. These classes define constants related to discovery endpoints and OAuth2 endpoints.
   - In branch `b`, a new static nested class `ErrorCode` is added, defining an error code constant `invalid_grant`.

   Since the base is empty, both branches are adding entirely new code. The conflict arises because both branches are adding new top-level static classes in the same file, and Git cannot automatically merge them due to overlapping file structure.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The `InstanceDiscoveryClaim` and `TenantDiscoveryClaim` classes in branch `a` are likely related to OpenID Connect or OAuth2 discovery mechanisms. These are important for integration with identity providers.
   - The `ErrorCode` class in branch `b` is likely used to represent standard OAuth2 or application-specific error codes, such as `invalid_grant`.

   Both sets of changes are valid and serve different purposes. There is no overlap in functionality or naming between the two branches.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of branch `a` is to define constants for discovery-related endpoints, likely for integration with identity providers.
   - The intention of branch `b` is to define standard error codes, likely for use in authentication or authorization logic.

   The intentions are orthogonal and complementary. There is no conflict in logic or naming.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches are adding new top-level classes with no overlapping names or logic, the correct resolution is to merge both sets of changes into the same file.
   - The final file should contain all three static nested classes: `InstanceDiscoveryClaim`, `TenantDiscoveryClaim`, and `ErrorCode`.
   - The order of the classes is arbitrary, but it is good practice to organize them logically (e.g., by related functionality).

```java
static final class InstanceDiscoveryClaim {
    static final String TENANT_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT = "tenant_discovery_endpoint";
}

static final class TenantDiscoveryClaim {
    static final String AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT = "authorization_endpoint";
    static final String TOKEN_ENDPOINT = "token_endpoint";
}

static final class ErrorCode {
    static final String INVALID_GRANT = "invalid_grant";
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
static final class ErrorCode {
        static final String INVALID_GRANT = "invalid_grant";
    }

    static final class InstanceDiscoveryClaim {
        static final String TENANT_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT = "tenant_discovery_endpoint";
    }

    static final class TenantDiscoveryClaim {
        static final String AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT = "authorization_endpoint";
        static final String TOKEN_ENDPOINT = "token_endpoint";
    }
