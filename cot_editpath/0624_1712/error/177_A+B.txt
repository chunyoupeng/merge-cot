### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a

<ADD> <newline> <newline>


## From base to b
<DELETE> if ( syntax instanceof PostgresqlSyntax ) { <newline>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes compared to `base`:**
     - The code in `a` is almost identical to the base, with the only difference being the formatting of the `String.format` call. In the base, the `String.format` is written on a single line with a long string. In `a`, the string is split into two lines for readability.
     - Additionally, there are some newline additions and deletions in the edit sequence, which likely reflect formatting changes.
   - **Branch `b` changes compared to `base`:**
     - The entire block of code related to creating child partition tables for PostgreSQL is removed. The `if (syntax instanceof PostgresqlSyntax)` block is deleted, and the corresponding code inside the loop is also removed.
     - This suggests that `b` is removing the logic for creating child partition tables for PostgreSQL, possibly because it is no longer needed or is being handled elsewhere.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The formatting change is minor and does not affect the logic of the code. It improves readability by splitting a long string into two lines.
     - This change is safe to keep and likely reflects a code style improvement.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The removal of the entire block of code is significant and changes the behavior of the program. If the logic for creating child partition tables is no longer needed, this change is valid.
     - However, if the logic is still required, this change would break the functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The intention appears to be to improve code readability by reformatting a long string into two lines. This is a minor change that does not affect the logic.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The intention appears to be to remove the logic for creating child partition tables for PostgreSQL. This could be because the functionality is no longer needed, or it is being handled elsewhere in the codebase.

4. **Final decision:**
   - If the logic for creating child partition tables for PostgreSQL is still required, then the code from `a` should be kept, as it only makes a formatting change that improves readability.
   - If the logic is no longer needed, then the code from `b` should be kept, as it removes the unnecessary code.
   - Since the problem does not provide additional context about whether the logic is still needed, the safest assumption is that it is still required. Therefore, the formatting change from `a` should be applied to the base code, and the logic from `b` should be discarded.

sql.append("; ");

    // create child partition tables for postgres
    for (int blockNum = 0; blockNum < blockCount; ++blockNum) {
      sql.append("create table ");
      if (query.isIfNotExists()) {
        sql.append("if not exists ");
