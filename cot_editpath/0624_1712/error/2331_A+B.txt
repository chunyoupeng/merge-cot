### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
*
     * @since 2.5
=======
*
     * @return {@code True} if the parser current points to specified token
     *
     * @since 2.5
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline> * @ return { @ code True } if the parser current points to specified token <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base version contains a Javadoc comment with a `@since 2.5` tag.
   - Branch `a` has removed all content from the base.
   - Branch `b` has added a new Javadoc comment line: `* @return {@code True} if the parser current points to specified token`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** completely removes the Javadoc comment. This could be an attempt to clean up or simplify the code, but it also removes potentially useful documentation.
   - **Branch `b`** adds a meaningful `@return` description to the Javadoc, which improves clarity and helps future developers understand the method's behavior.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to remove outdated or unnecessary documentation.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to enhance documentation by adding a `@return` tag that clarifies the method's return value.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of branch `b` is to improve documentation, which is a positive change.
   - The complete removal of the Javadoc in branch `a` is too drastic and discards useful information.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the `@return` description from branch `b` and retain the `@since 2.5` tag from the base.
