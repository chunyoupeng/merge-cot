### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

import liquibase.statement.CallableSqlStatement;

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> * <WITH> CallableSqlStatement)
<REPLACE> core <WITH> ExecutablePreparedStatement)
<ADD> ; <newline> import liquibase
<REPLACE> RawSqlStatement <WITH> statement)
<ADD> . SqlStatement


## From base to b
<ADD> import liquibase . sqlgenerator . SqlGeneratorFactory ; <newline>
<DELETE> <newline> import liquibase . statement . core . RawSqlStatement ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaces the wildcard import `import liquibase.statement.*;` with explicit imports: `CallableSqlStatement`, `ExecutablePreparedStatement`, and `SqlStatement`.
     - Removes the import for `RawSqlStatement` and replaces it with `SqlStatement`.
     - Adds a new line with an import for `SqlStatement` (possibly redundant).
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Adds an import for `SqlGeneratorFactory`.
     - Removes the import for `RawSqlStatement`.

   The conflict is centered around the import statements, particularly the handling of `RawSqlStatement`, `SqlStatement`, and the addition of `SqlGeneratorFactory`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The switch from wildcard imports to explicit imports is a common practice to improve clarity and avoid naming conflicts.
     - Replacing `RawSqlStatement` with `SqlStatement` may indicate that `RawSqlStatement` is no longer needed or has been replaced in the logic.
     - The addition of `SqlStatement` as an explicit import may be redundant if it's already imported via wildcard or another explicit import.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Adding `SqlGeneratorFactory` is likely necessary for new functionality involving SQL generation.
     - Removing `RawSqlStatement` aligns with `a`'s change, suggesting that this class is no longer used.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely refactoring the code to use more specific imports and remove unused classes like `RawSqlStatement`.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding a dependency on `SqlGeneratorFactory`, which may be part of a new feature or logic involving SQL generation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches agree on removing `RawSqlStatement`, so that can be safely kept.
   - Branch `a`'s explicit imports (`CallableSqlStatement`, `ExecutablePreparedStatement`, `SqlStatement`) are more specific and should be retained.
   - Branch `b`'s addition of `SqlGeneratorFactory` is also necessary and should be included.
   - The redundant import of `SqlStatement` in `a` can be removed to avoid duplication.

   The final import list should include all necessary explicit imports and the new `SqlGeneratorFactory`.
