### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

* Adds {@code constraint} to the list of constraints.

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> constraint <WITH> inheritedColumn)
<REPLACE> constraints <WITH> inheritedColumns)
<REPLACE> constraint <WITH> inheritedColumn)
<REPLACE> constraint <WITH> inheritedColumn)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> *


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the method comment describes adding a `constraint` to the list of `constraints`.
   - In branch `a`, the method comment has been modified to refer to `inheritedColumn` and `inheritedColumns` instead of `constraint` and `constraints`.
   - In branch `b`, the method comment has been modified to add a new line with `*` in the Javadoc parameter description, likely for formatting or clarity.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is changing the semantic meaning of the method from handling constraints to handling inherited columns. This is a significant change and likely reflects a different feature or refactor.
   - **Branch `b`** is making a minor formatting or stylistic change to the Javadoc comment, adding a new line with a `*` for better readability.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely represents a refactor or new feature where the method is now used to add inherited columns instead of constraints.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely a code style or documentation improvement, aiming to make the Javadoc more readable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` is changing the core functionality of the method (from handling constraints to inherited columns), it is a more substantial change and should be prioritized.
   - The formatting change in `b` can be applied on top of `a`'s changes to maintain readability.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should include the changes from `a` and apply the formatting improvement from `b`.
