### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the Javadoc comment for the method includes parameter descriptions with no specific formatting for the parameter names.
   - In branch `a`, the parameter descriptions are unchanged, but the line starting with `*` is preserved, which appears to be a formatting placeholder or artifact.
   - In branch `b`, the parameter descriptions are reformatted with additional indentation and spacing for the parameter names (`users`, `subject`, `status`, `changeDate`), likely to improve readability and align with a more consistent Javadoc style.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Branch `a` retains the original formatting, including the `*` line, which may be unnecessary or a leftover from an earlier edit.
   - Branch `b` improves the formatting of the Javadoc by aligning the parameter names and descriptions, which is a common and recommended style in Java documentation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` seems to be to preserve the existing structure, possibly without realizing the `*` line is redundant.
   - The intention of `b` is to enhance the readability and maintainability of the Javadoc by aligning the parameter names and descriptions.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The formatting in `b` is more readable and follows standard Javadoc conventions.
   - The `*` line in `a` appears to be an artifact and should be removed.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the formatting from `b` and discard the unnecessary line from `a`.
