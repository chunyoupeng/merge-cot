### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> < ? >


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline>
<ADD> , Boolean defLeniency <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the method signature includes a parameter `VisibilityChecker<?> defVisibility`.
   - In `a`, the parameter is changed to `VisibilityChecker defVisibility`, removing the wildcard (`<?>`).
   - In `b`, a new parameter `Boolean defLeniency` is added to the method signature, and two newlines are inserted for formatting.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** Removing the wildcard (`<?>`) from `VisibilityChecker<?>` to `VisibilityChecker` is a type erasure change. This could be intentional if the code no longer needs to enforce generic type safety for `defVisibility`. However, removing the wildcard might reduce type safety and could lead to unchecked cast warnings.
   - **Change in `b`:** Adding a new parameter `Boolean defLeniency` introduces a new configuration option. This is a logical extension of the method's functionality. The formatting changes (adding newlines) are minor and likely for readability.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention of `a`:** Likely to simplify the method signature by removing generic type constraints, possibly for backward compatibility or to reduce complexity.
   - **Intention of `b`:** To extend the method's functionality by adding a new configuration parameter, which suggests the method is being enhanced to support more flexible behavior.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The wildcard removal in `a` is a minor change that could be kept if the generic type is no longer needed. However, it's safer to retain the wildcard unless there's a strong reason to remove it.
   - The addition of `defLeniency` in `b` is a clear enhancement and should be retained.
   - The formatting change in `b` (adding newlines) is acceptable and improves readability.

   Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the wildcard from `base`, add the new parameter from `b`, and retain the formatting improvement.
