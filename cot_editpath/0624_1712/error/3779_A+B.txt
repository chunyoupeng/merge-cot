### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> public boolean isAddSupportedVersionsExtension ( ) { <newline> return addSupportedVersionsExtension ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> public void setAddSupportedVersionsExtension ( boolean addSupportedVersionsExtension ) { <newline> this . addSupportedVersionsExtension = addSupportedVersionsExtension ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> public boolean isAddKeyShareExtension ( ) { <newline> return addKeyShareExtension ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> public void setAddKeyShareExtension ( boolean addKeyShareExtension ) { <newline> this . addKeyShareExtension = addKeyShareExtension ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** has completely removed all content from the base. This means that the `getPrivateKey()` and `setPrivateKey(PrivateKey)` methods are gone.
   - **Branch `b`** has added four new methods: `isAddSupportedVersionsExtension()`, `setAddSupportedVersionsExtension(boolean)`, `isAddKeyShareExtension()`, and `setAddKeyShareExtension(boolean)`. These are new boolean properties related to TLS extensions. The `getPrivateKey()` and `setPrivateKey(PrivateKey)` methods from the base are preserved in `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is to remove all content. This is likely a mistake or a misoperation, as it discards all existing functionality without adding anything in return. It is not a meaningful or intentional change.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is to add new functionality related to TLS extensions. These are valid and useful additions that enhance the class's capabilities. The `getPrivateKey()` and `setPrivateKey(PrivateKey)` methods are preserved, which is correct.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intended to remove the `getPrivateKey()` and `setPrivateKey(PrivateKey)` methods for some reason (e.g., deprecation or refactoring), but the complete removal of all content suggests an error.
   - **Branch `b`** clearly intended to add new configuration options for TLS extensions, which is a logical and valid enhancement.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a`'s change is to remove all content, it is not a valid or useful change and should be discarded.
   - Branch `b`'s change adds meaningful functionality and preserves the existing `getPrivateKey()` and `setPrivateKey(PrivateKey)` methods. Therefore, the resolution should keep all of `b`'s changes.
