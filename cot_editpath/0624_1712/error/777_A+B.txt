### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a new parameter `blobStorageCleaner` to the `HollowProducer` constructor and introduced a new abstract class `BlobStorageCleaner` with a method `clean(Blob.Type)` that handles cleaning logic for different blob types.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new parameter `metricsCollector` to the `HollowProducer` constructor.

   The conflict occurs in the `HollowProducer` constructor call, where both branches added a new parameter to the list.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a new abstraction for blob storage cleaning, which is a meaningful addition if the system needs to support blob-specific cleanup logic. The `BlobStorageCleaner` class provides a flexible and extensible design.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces a `metricsCollector`, which is likely used for collecting performance or usage metrics. This is also a meaningful addition for monitoring and observability.

   Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. There is no overlap in functionality, and both parameters are likely to be used independently.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to provide a mechanism for cleaning blob storage based on blob type, which is a new feature.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to add a metrics collection capability, which is also a new feature.

   The intentions are orthogonal and complementary. There is no conflict in logic or design.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are additive and do not interfere with each other, the best resolution is to **combine both changes**.
   - The `HollowProducer` constructor should include both `blobStorageCleaner` and `metricsCollector` as parameters.
   - The `BlobStorageCleaner` class should be retained as it is.
