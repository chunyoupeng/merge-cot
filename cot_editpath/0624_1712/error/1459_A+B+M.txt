### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR(49, "Parse number exception"),
    UNKNOWN_LINK_TYPE(50, "Emule link has unrecognized type"),
    FAIL(51, "Fail");
||||||| base

=======
PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED(49, "Packet header contains wrong bytes or undefined"),
    FAIL(60, "Fail");
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR ( 49 , " Parse number exception " ) , <newline> UNKNOWN_LINK_TYPE ( 50 , " Emule link has unrecognized type " ) , <newline>
<REPLACE> 49 <WITH> 51)


## From base to b
<ADD> PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED ( 49 , " Packet header contains wrong bytes or undefined " ) , <newline>
<REPLACE> 49 <WITH> 60)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, there is an enum constant `FAIL(49, "Fail");`.
   - In branch `a`, the code adds two new enum constants: `NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR(49, "Parse number exception")` and `UNKNOWN_LINK_TYPE(50, "Emule link has unrecognized type")`. It also changes the code number of `FAIL` from 49 to 51.
   - In branch `b`, the code adds a new enum constant `PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED(49, "Packet header contains wrong bytes or undefined")` and changes the code number of `FAIL` from 49 to 60.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - Adding `NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR` and `UNKNOWN_LINK_TYPE` introduces new error codes for parsing and Emule link issues.
     - Changing `FAIL` from 49 to 51 suggests that the code number 49 is now used by `NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR`.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Adding `PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED` introduces a new error code for packet header issues.
     - Changing `FAIL` from 49 to 60 suggests that the code number 49 is now used by `PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Both branches aim to introduce new error codes and reassign the `FAIL` code to a new number to avoid conflicts.
   - The intention is to maintain unique error codes and ensure that each error has a distinct identifier.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The code number 49 is used in both branches for different purposes: `NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR` in `a` and `PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED` in `b`.
   - The code number 51 is used in `a` for `FAIL`, and 60 is used in `b` for `FAIL`.
   - To resolve the conflict, we need to ensure that all error codes are unique and that the `FAIL` code is consistent.
   - A reasonable resolution is to keep both new error codes (`NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR` and `PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED`) and assign them to the code numbers 49 and 50 respectively.
   - The `FAIL` code should be assigned to a new unique number, such as 60, to avoid conflicts.

# </cot>

# Final Resolution
```java
NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR(49, "Parse number exception"),
    PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED(50, "Packet header contains wrong bytes or undefined"),
    UNKNOWN_LINK_TYPE(51, "Emule link has unrecognized type"),
    FAIL(60, "Fail");
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
NUMBER_FORMAT_ERROR(49, "Parse number exception"),
    UNKNOWN_LINK_TYPE(50, "Emule link has unrecognized type"),
    FAIL(51, "Fail");
    PACKET_HEADER_UNDEFINED(49, "Packet header contains wrong bytes or undefined"),
    FAIL(60, "Fail");
