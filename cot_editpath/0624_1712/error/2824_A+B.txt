### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (mView.getApplication().has(Feature.G3D_AR_SHOW_RATIO)
                 && ratioIsShown) {
            showSnackbar();
        }
||||||| base
if (mView.getApplication().has(Feature.G3D_AR_SHOW_RATIO)) {
            showSnackbar();
        }
=======
calculateAndShowRatio();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> & & ratioIsShown


## From base to b
<REPLACE> if <WITH> calculateAndShowRatio)
<DELETE> ( mView . getApplication ( ) . has ( Feature . G3D_AR_SHOW_RATIO ) ) { <newline> showSnackbar <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a condition `&& ratioIsShown` to the existing `if` statement. This means the `showSnackbar()` will only be called if both `Feature.G3D_AR_SHOW_RATIO` is present and `ratioIsShown` is true.
   - **Branch `b`** completely removed the `if` condition and the `showSnackbar()` call, and instead replaced it with a direct call to `calculateAndShowRatio();`. This suggests that the logic for showing the ratio has been moved or encapsulated into a new method.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a conditional guard that depends on an additional flag (`ratioIsShown`). This is a conservative change that preserves the original logic but adds a new condition.
   - **Branch `b`** removes the original logic and replaces it with a new method call. This implies a refactoring or a change in how the ratio is shown, possibly to encapsulate more logic or improve readability.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to control when the snackbar is shown based on a new flag, possibly for feature toggling or conditional UI behavior.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to simplify or refactor the logic by moving it into a dedicated method, which could improve maintainability and reduce duplication.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b` is replacing the entire logic with a new method call, it's likely that the original logic in `a` is no longer needed or is now encapsulated in `calculateAndShowRatio()`.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the logic from `b`, as it represents a more comprehensive change that likely subsumes the purpose of `a`'s addition.
   - However, if `ratioIsShown` is a critical flag that should still influence the behavior, it should be passed to `calculateAndShowRatio()` as a parameter. But since this is not the case in the current code, we assume the new method already handles the necessary logic.
