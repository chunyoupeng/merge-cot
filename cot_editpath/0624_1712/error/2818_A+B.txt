### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the `@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)` annotation to the `@Configuration` class. This is a common Spring optimization to disable proxying of bean methods, which can improve performance in certain scenarios.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new method `getFilters(...)` that retrieves a list of `WebFilter` instances from a `SecurityWebFilterChain` using reflection. This method is likely used for testing or introspection purposes.

   The conflict arises because both changes are applied to the same class, but they modify different parts of the code. There is no direct overlap in the lines modified.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is a configuration-level optimization. It does not interfere with the logic of the class and is a valid and safe addition.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces a new method that is likely used for testing or inspection of the filter chain. It is a functional addition and does not conflict with the configuration change from `a`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to optimize the configuration class by disabling proxying of bean methods, which is a best practice in Spring for performance-sensitive code.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to provide a utility method for retrieving and filtering `WebFilter` instances, likely for testing or debugging purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the two changes are orthogonal and do not conflict with each other, the best resolution is to **combine both changes**.
   - The `@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)` from `a` should be retained to maintain the performance optimization.
   - The `getFilters(...)` method from `b` should be retained to preserve the testing functionality.
   - No modifications are needed to either change to make them compatible.
