### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to b
<DELETE> static


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Adds a new method `buildOutputKeyField` which handles key field logic based on partitioning.
     - Replaces `KsqlSchema` with `LogicalSchema` in the method `getTimestampExtractionPolicy`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Removes the `static` modifier from the method `getTimestampExtractionPolicy`.

   The conflict occurs in the method `getTimestampExtractionPolicy`. Both branches modify this method:
   - `a` changes the parameter from `KsqlSchema` to `LogicalSchema`.
   - `b` removes the `static` keyword.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** Replacing `KsqlSchema` with `LogicalSchema` suggests a refactoring to use a different schema representation. This is likely a structural or architectural change and should be preserved if it aligns with the project's direction.
   - **Change in `b`:** Removing `static` implies the method is now instance-based, which may be necessary if the method relies on instance state or if it's part of a broader design shift. This change should also be preserved if it reflects a valid design decision.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to modernize/refactor the schema handling by switching to `LogicalSchema`, and to add a new method for key field logic.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to make the method `getTimestampExtractionPolicy` non-static, likely to allow it to access or use instance variables or to align with an object-oriented design.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The parameter type change (`KsqlSchema` â†’ `LogicalSchema`) and the removal of `static` are orthogonal and can be applied together.
   - The correct resolution is to apply both changes: use `LogicalSchema` as the parameter type and make the method non-static.
