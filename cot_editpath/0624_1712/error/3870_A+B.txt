### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

if(terminal.isEscape()) {
               writer.writeText(welcomeMessage, null);
            } else {

if (terminal.isEscape()) {

            }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> { } { <newline> }


## From base to b
<ADD> { } <newline> { <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the `if-else` block that checks `terminal.isEscape()` and writes the `welcomeMessage` accordingly.
   - **From base to a:** The only change is the addition of `{ }` around the `if` and `else` blocks, and a `<newline>` is added. This suggests that the code was formatted for better readability by adding braces and newlines.
   - **From base to b:** The changes include adding `{ }` around the `if` block, a `<newline>`, and then another `{ }` and `<newline>` for the `else` block. This implies that the `else` block was also explicitly enclosed in braces and formatted with newlines.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a:** Adds braces and a newline to both the `if` and `else` blocks. This is a standard practice for readability and to avoid potential bugs from missing braces in the future.
   - **Branch b:** Adds braces and newlines to both the `if` and `else` blocks, but the formatting is slightly more verbose. The extra newline after the `else` block may be unnecessary but doesn't affect correctness.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Both branches aim to improve code readability and maintainability by adding braces and formatting the code with newlines.
   - The intention is to make the code more robust and easier to read, especially for future developers who may modify the code.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches are making similar improvements, but **branch b** adds an extra newline after the `else` block, which is unnecessary and could be considered a minor formatting inconsistency.
   - **Branch a** provides a cleaner and more consistent formatting.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to adopt the formatting from **branch a**, as it achieves the same goal with cleaner formatting.

```java
if(terminal.isEscape()) {
               writer.writeText(welcomeMessage, null);
            } else {
               writer.write(welcomeMessage);
            }
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
if (terminal.isEscape()) {
                writer.writeText(welcomeMessage, null);
            else {
            }
                writer.write(welcomeMessage);
            }
