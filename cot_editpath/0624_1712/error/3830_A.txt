### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the Javadoc comment (`@since 2.9`) from the constructor.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new deprecated constructor with Javadoc (`@deprecated in 2.12, remove from 3.0`), annotations (`@SuppressWarnings`, `@Deprecated`), and a new constructor signature with additional parameters (`BeanProperty`, `JsonSerializer<?>`, `Set<String>`).
   - The conflict is in the same constructor method, but the changes are not overlapping in the same lines. `a` modifies the existing constructor by removing its Javadoc, while `b` adds a new deprecated constructor and retains the original constructor with Javadoc.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing the Javadoc comment (`@since 2.9`) might indicate that the constructor is being deprecated or is no longer relevant for version tracking. However, it's unclear why this change was made without adding a deprecation notice.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding a deprecated constructor with a clear deprecation message and annotations is a more informative and standard way to handle deprecation. It also introduces a new constructor with more parameters, which suggests an evolution of the API.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** Likely to deprecate or remove the constructor, but the approach is minimal and lacks clarity.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** Clearly deprecate the constructor with a message and provide a new constructor with more flexibility. This is a more robust and maintainable approach.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Branch `b`'s changes are more comprehensive and follow best practices for deprecation. The constructor from `b` should be retained, including the new deprecated constructor and the original constructor with Javadoc.
   - The change from `a` (removing the Javadoc) is redundant or unnecessary in the context of `b`'s more detailed deprecation.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include the full content from `b`, as it provides a clearer and more complete picture of the API's evolution.
