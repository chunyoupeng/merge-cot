### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> IllegalArgumentException , <newline> NoSuchFieldException , IllegalAccessException , ClassNotFoundException , <newline> NoSuchMethodException , InstantiationException , InvocationTargetException , <newline> NoSuchAlgorithmException , NoSuchPaddingException ,


## From base to b
<REPLACE> testScenario_Empty_IdToken <WITH> testScenarioEmptyIdToken)
<DELETE> , IllegalArgumentException


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Renamed the method to `testScenario_Empty_IdToken()` (no change in name compared to base).
     - Removed the exception `IllegalArgumentException` from the method's throws clause.
     - Removed the newline formatting for the list of exceptions.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Renamed the method to `testScenarioEmptyIdToken()` (removed underscores and made it camelCase).
     - Also removed the exception `IllegalArgumentException` from the method's throws clause.
     - Kept the newline formatting for the list of exceptions.

   The conflict arises in two areas:
   - The method name: `testScenario_Empty_IdToken` (a) vs. `testScenarioEmptyIdToken` (b).
   - The list of exceptions: both removed `IllegalArgumentException`, but differ in formatting.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Method name**:
     - **Branch a** keeps the underscore-separated format, which is common in Java for readability in test method names.
     - **Branch b** uses camelCase, which is also a valid Java naming convention and is often used in Java for method names.
     - Both are acceptable, but the camelCase version (`testScenarioEmptyIdToken`) is more in line with standard Java method naming conventions.
   - **Exception list**:
     - Both branches removed `IllegalArgumentException`, which suggests that this exception is no longer thrown by the method.
     - **Branch a** removed the newline formatting, making the list more compact.
     - **Branch b** kept the newline formatting, which can improve readability for long lists.
     - The formatting choice is a matter of style, and both are acceptable.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely aimed to simplify the method signature by removing unnecessary exceptions and compacting the list.
   - **Branch b** likely aimed to modernize the method name to follow Java naming conventions and retain readability in the exception list.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method name should be resolved to `testScenarioEmptyIdToken`, as it follows standard Java naming conventions.
   - The exception list should retain the newline formatting for readability, as it is a common practice in Java for long lists.
   - The removal of `IllegalArgumentException` is consistent in both branches and should be kept.
