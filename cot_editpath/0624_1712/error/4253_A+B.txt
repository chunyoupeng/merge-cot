### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base is empty, meaning both branches `a` and `b` have independently added new content.
   - Branch `a` added:
     ```java
     public static final Block JACK;
     public static final Block JACK_HEAD;
     ```
   - Branch `b` added:
     ```java
     public static final Block BOOST_PAD;
     public static final Block BOOST_RAMP;
     public static final Block STEEP_BOOST_RAMP;

     public static final Block FUELIUM;
     public static final Block ENDER_SAP;
     public static final Block BLAZE_JUICE;
     public static final Block FLUID_EXTRACTOR;
     public static final Block FLUID_MIXER;
     public static final Block GAS_PUMP;
     public static final Block FLUID_PIPE;
     public static final Block FLUID_PUMP;
     public static final Block FUEL_DRUM;
     public static final Block INDUSTRIAL_FUEL_DRUM;
     public static final Block WORKSTATION;
     public static final Block VEHICLE_CRATE;
     ```
   - The conflict is not about overwriting or modifying the same lines but about combining two sets of new additions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of additions are new and do not conflict with each other in terms of content.
   - Branch `a` introduces two block constants related to "JACK" and "JACK_HEAD", likely for a new block or item.
   - Branch `b` introduces a larger set of blocks related to a more complex system, possibly for a mod or expansion involving fuel, fluid handling, and vehicle crates.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to introduce a new block or item (JACK) and its head variant.
   - The intention of `b` is to introduce a suite of blocks for a more complex system involving fuel, fluid handling, and vehicle crates.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of additions are new and do not overlap, the best resolution is to combine both sets into a single list.
   - The order of the constants can be preserved as per their original branches, with `a`'s additions placed before `b`'s for clarity and to maintain the order of introduction.
   - This ensures that all new blocks are included without any loss of functionality or intention.
