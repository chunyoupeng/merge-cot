### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

import thredds.client.catalog.Catalog;

import ucar.unidata.test.util.ThreddsServer;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> client .
<REPLACE> InvCatalogFactory <WITH> Catalog)
<ADD> client .
<REPLACE> InvCatalogImpl <WITH> builder)
<ADD> . CatalogBuilder
<DELETE> <newline> import ucar . unidata . test . util . NotTravis ;


## From base to b
<REPLACE> NotTravis <WITH> ThreddsServer)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced `InvCatalogFactory` with `Catalog`.
     - Replaced `InvCatalogImpl` with `CatalogBuilder`.
     - Added `import thredds.client.catalog.Catalog;` and `import thredds.client.catalog.builder.CatalogBuilder;`.
     - Removed the import `import ucar.unidata.test.util.NotTravis;`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Replaced `NotTravis` with `ThreddsServer`.
   - The conflict is in the import statements and the renaming of classes. Both branches are modifying the same base imports in different ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - It appears to be modernizing or refactoring the code to use a new package structure (`thredds.client.catalog`) instead of the older `thredds.catalog`.
     - Removing `NotTravis` suggests the test is no longer conditional on Travis CI.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - It is updating the test utility to use `ThreddsServer`, which may be a more robust or updated version of `NotTravis`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely updating the code to use a newer version of the THREDDS library, which has moved or renamed classes.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely updating the test utility to use a more appropriate or updated class for test execution.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The import statements from `a` are more comprehensive and reflect a broader modernization effort.
   - The `ThreddsServer` import from `b` is a useful addition and should be included alongside the imports from `a`.
   - The `NotTravis` import is obsolete and should be removed.
   - The resolution should include all the new imports from `a` and the updated test utility from `b`.
