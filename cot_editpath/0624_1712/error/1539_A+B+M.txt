### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaced "Is" with "Get" in the method comment.
     - Added "the proxy policy rules for" to the method comment.
     - Replaced "application" with "service".
     - Replaced "allowed" with "." (likely a typo or formatting error).
     - Removed the phrase "to take part in the proxying capabilities of * CAS?" from the method comment.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Removed the entire method `isIgnoreAttributes()` and `getAllowedAttributes()` along with their comments.
     - This suggests that `b` is removing these methods entirely, likely deprecating or refactoring them.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The changes to the method comment suggest an effort to clarify or rephrase the method's purpose.
     - The replacement of "Is" with "Get" and the addition of "the proxy policy rules for" indicate an attempt to make the method's purpose clearer.
     - The replacement of "application" with "service" and "allowed" with "." seems like a formatting or typo fix.
     - The removal of the phrase "to take part in the proxying capabilities of * CAS?" appears to be an effort to simplify or clarify the method's description.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The removal of the two methods and their comments suggests a more significant change, possibly removing functionality that is no longer needed or has been moved elsewhere.
     - This change is more disruptive and could indicate a refactoring or deprecation of these methods.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To improve the clarity and correctness of the method comments and possibly rename or rephrase the method's purpose.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To remove the methods entirely, likely because they are no longer needed or have been replaced by other functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b` is removing the methods entirely, and `a` is only modifying the comments, the most logical resolution is to keep the removal from `b` and discard the comment changes from `a`.
   - The methods `isIgnoreAttributes()` and `getAllowedAttributes()` are being removed, so their comments should also be removed.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the changes from `b` and remove the methods and their comments.
