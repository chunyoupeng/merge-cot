### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added two new parameters to the `IntersectingSourceState` constructor: `viewFrustumProperty` and `eyeToWorldTransformProperty`.
   - **Branch `b`** completely restructured the code to include conditional logic based on the type of `labelState`. It introduces:
     - An `if-else` structure to check if `labelState` is of type `ConnectomicsLabelState` or `LabelSourceState`.
     - A `throw` clause for invalid types.
     - A more specific constructor call depending on the type of `labelState`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** adds two new parameters to the constructor. This suggests that the `IntersectingSourceState` now requires additional properties (`viewFrustumProperty` and `eyeToWorldTransformProperty`) for its operation. This is a straightforward extension of the existing logic.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** introduces type-specific behavior. This implies that the behavior of `IntersectingSourceState` should differ depending on the type of `labelState`. This is a more significant architectural change, adding conditional logic and type checking.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to enhance the `IntersectingSourceState` with additional properties for rendering or transformation logic.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to enforce stricter type constraints on the `labelState` input, ensuring that only valid types are used to construct `IntersectingSourceState`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in **branch `b`** are more structural and introduce conditional logic that affects the behavior of the method. This suggests a more fundamental change in how the `IntersectingSourceState` is constructed.
   - The changes in **branch `a`** are additive and can be integrated into the logic of `b` by adding the new parameters to both constructor calls in the `if-else` block.
   - Therefore, the resolution should retain the conditional logic from `b` and incorporate the new parameters from `a` into both constructor calls.
