### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added several imports related to `common` packages:
     - `org.apache.asterix.common.functions.ExternalFunctionLanguage`
     - `org.apache.asterix.common.library.ILibrary`
     - `org.apache.asterix.common.metadata.DataverseName`
   - **Branch `b`** modified the import statements to use `common` instead of `api` in the package structure. Specifically:
     - Changed `org.apache.asterix.external.api.IAdapterFactory` to `org.apache.asterix.common.external.ITypedAdapterFactory`
     - Changed `org.apache.asterix.external.api.IDataSourceAdapter` to `org.apache.asterix.common.external.IDataSourceAdapter`
     - Changed `org.apache.asterix.external.api.IDataSourceAdapter.AdapterType` to `org.apache.asterix.common.external.IDataSourceAdapter.AdapterType`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely modernizing or modularizing the code by using `common` packages instead of `api` packages. This could be part of a broader effort to reorganize the codebase.
   - **Branch `b`** is also moving away from the `api` package and using `common` packages, but with a different naming convention (`ITypedAdapterFactory` instead of `IAdapterFactory`). This suggests a design change or refactoring to support typed adapters.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely preparing the code for a modular architecture by importing more common utilities and metadata types.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely refactoring the adapter system to support typed factories, which could improve type safety and reduce runtime errors.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches are moving toward using `common` packages instead of `api` packages, which is a positive trend.
   - However, `b` introduces a new interface (`ITypedAdapterFactory`) that is not present in `a`, which suggests it is more specific to the new design.
   - To resolve the conflict, we should **keep the imports from `b`** and **add the imports from `a`** that are not already included in `b`, as they are likely needed for the broader modularization effort.
   - The imports from `a` that are not in `b` are:
     - `org.apache.asterix.common.functions.ExternalFunctionLanguage`
     - `org.apache.asterix.common.library.ILibrary`
     - `org.apache.asterix.common.metadata.DataverseName`

# Final Resolution
```java
import org.apache.asterix.common.functions.ExternalFunctionLanguage;
import org.apache.asterix.common.library.ILibrary;
import org.apache.asterix.common.metadata.DataverseName;
import org.apache.asterix.common.external.ITypedAdapterFactory;
import org.apache.asterix.common.external.IDataSourceAdapter;
import org.apache.asterix.common.external.IDataSourceAdapter.AdapterType;
```
