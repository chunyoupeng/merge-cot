### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import com.github.tessera.config.KeyDataConfig;
||||||| base

=======
import com.github.tessera.config.PrivateKeyData;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**  
   - The conflict is in the import statement.  
   - `a` added the import: `import com.github.tessera.config.KeyDataConfig;`  
   - `b` added the import: `import com.github.tessera.config.PrivateKeyData;`  
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own imports.

2. **Evaluate each change:**  
   - Both `KeyDataConfig` and `PrivateKeyData` are likely related to configuration or data handling in the `tessera` library.  
   - `KeyDataConfig` might be a configuration class for key data, while `PrivateKeyData` might represent the actual private key data structure.  
   - Both imports are valid and likely necessary for their respective features.  
   - There is no overlap or conflict in the imports themselves, as they are distinct classes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**  
   - The intention of `a` is to use `KeyDataConfig` for configuration purposes.  
   - The intention of `b` is to use `PrivateKeyData` for handling private key data.  
   - These are likely separate features or enhancements that both require their own imports.

4. **Final decision:**  
   - Since both imports are distinct and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to include both imports in the final code.  
   - This ensures that both features remain functional and no functionality is lost due to the merge.
