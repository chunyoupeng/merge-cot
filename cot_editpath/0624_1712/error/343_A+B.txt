### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In this case, the base is empty, so both branches `a` and `b` are adding new content.
   - Branch `a` adds three constants related to ODKTables file upload/download and CSV upload.
   - Branch `b` adds one constant related to uploading a service account private key.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of changes are introducing new constants for different purposes.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in the content itself, as they are defining different constants for different functionalities.
   - Both changes are valid and serve distinct purposes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` is likely extending the functionality of a system that handles ODKTables data, adding endpoints for file and CSV operations.
   - Branch `b` is likely adding support for OAuth2 service account functionality, specifically for uploading a private key.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of changes are non-conflicting and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both sets of constants.
   - The final code should include all four constants, preserving the clarity and structure of the original additions.
