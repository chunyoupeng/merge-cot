### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public double getFetchedBlocks(ObjectContainer container) {
		if(persistenceType == PERSIST_FOREVER && progressPending != null)
			container.activate(progressPending, 2);
||||||| base
public double getFetchedBlocks() {
=======
@Override
	public double getFetchedBlocks() {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ObjectContainer container <newline> if ( persistenceType = = PERSIST_FOREVER & & progressPending ! = null ) <newline> container . activate ( progressPending , 2 ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Override <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a parameter `ObjectContainer container` to the method `getFetchedBlocks()`. It also added a conditional block that activates `progressPending` using the container if `persistenceType` is `PERSIST_FOREVER` and `progressPending` is not null.
   - **Branch `b`** added the `@Override` annotation to the method `getFetchedBlocks()`, indicating that it is overriding a method from a superclass or interface.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** introduces a new parameter and logic. This suggests that the method now depends on an `ObjectContainer` for activation logic, which may be necessary for persistence or lazy loading.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** adds the `@Override` annotation, which is a good practice for clarity and to ensure the method is indeed overriding a parent method. This is a minimal but important change for code correctness and maintainability.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to enhance the method's functionality by incorporating container-based activation logic, which may be required for object persistence or lazy loading.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to ensure the method is correctly overriding a parent method, which is a good practice in object-oriented programming.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `@Override` annotation from branch `b` should be retained for clarity and correctness.
   - The parameter `ObjectContainer container` and the conditional logic from branch `a` should also be retained, as they likely represent a functional enhancement.
   - The method signature from branch `a` should be used, with the `@Override` annotation from branch `b` added to it.

```java
@Override
public double getFetchedBlocks(ObjectContainer container) {
    if (persistenceType == PERSIST_FOREVER && progressPending != null)
        container.activate(progressPending, 2);
}
```

	public double getFetchedBlocks(ObjectContainer container) {
		if(persistenceType == PERSIST_FOREVER && progressPending != null)
			container.activate(progressPending, 2);
