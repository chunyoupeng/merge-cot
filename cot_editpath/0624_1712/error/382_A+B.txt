### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
blobStorageCleaner.clean(blobType);
||||||| base

=======
metrics.updateBlobTypeMetrics(builder.build());
            if(metricsCollector !=null)
                metricsCollector.collect(metrics);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` have added new lines of code at the same location in the base (which is empty).
   - Branch `a` added: `blobStorageCleaner.clean(blobType);`
   - Branch `b` added: 
     ```
     metrics.updateBlobTypeMetrics(builder.build());
     if(metricsCollector !=null)
         metricsCollector.collect(metrics);
     ```

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** This line appears to be invoking a method to clean up blob storage of a specific type. It is likely part of a cleanup or maintenance process.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** These lines are updating metrics with some built object and then collecting those metrics if a collector is available. This is likely part of a monitoring or logging system.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To perform a cleanup operation on blob storage, possibly to remove outdated or unnecessary data.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To update and collect metrics, likely for performance tracking or system health monitoring.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are semantically distinct and serve different purposes: one is for cleanup, the other for metrics collection.
   - There is no overlap or conflict in functionality, so both changes should be retained.
   - The resolution should include both lines of code in the correct order, ensuring that the metrics are updated and collected after the blob is cleaned (assuming the blob is part of the metrics).

```java
blobStorageCleaner.clean(blobType);
metrics.updateBlobTypeMetrics(builder.build());
if(metricsCollector !=null)
    metricsCollector.collect(metrics);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
metrics.updateBlobTypeMetrics(builder.build());
            if(metricsCollector !=null)
                metricsCollector.collect(metrics);
            blobStorageCleaner.clean(blobType);
