### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import us.ihmc.humanoidRobotics.communication.packets.SE3WaypointMessage;
import us.ihmc.humanoidRobotics.communication.packets.SO3WaypointMessage;
||||||| base

=======
import us.ihmc.humanoidRobotics.communication.packets.SE3TrajectoryPointMessage;
import us.ihmc.humanoidRobotics.communication.packets.SO3TrajectoryPointMessage;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements.
   - Branch `a` imports `SE3WaypointMessage` and `SO3WaypointMessage`.
   - Branch `b` imports `SE3TrajectoryPointMessage` and `SO3TrajectoryPointMessage`.
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own import statements.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `SE3WaypointMessage` and `SO3WaypointMessage` likely represent waypoint-based motion data (e.g., a sequence of points to reach).
   - `SE3TrajectoryPointMessage` and `SO3TrajectoryPointMessage` likely represent trajectory-based motion data (e.g., time-stamped points with velocities or accelerations).
   - Both sets of imports are valid and serve different purposes. There is no direct overlap or conflict in the functionality they provide.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` is likely implementing a system that uses waypoints for motion planning.
   - Branch `b` is likely implementing a system that uses trajectory points for more detailed motion control.
   - The intention is to support different types of motion data structures, not to replace one another.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of imports are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to include both sets of imports.
   - This ensures that the merged code supports both waypoint-based and trajectory-based functionality.
   - No changes need to be made to the import statements themselves, only to resolve the conflict by combining both sets.
