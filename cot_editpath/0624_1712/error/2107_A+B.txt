### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> fetchOperations <WITH> getRemoteSupportedOperations)
<DELETE> throws StoreException
<REPLACE> final <WITH> try)
<ADD> { <newline> <newline> } catch ( final StoreException e ) { <newline> throw new GafferRuntimeException ( " Failed to fetch operations from remote store . " , e ) ; <newline> }


## From base to b
<DELETE> ( Set )
<REPLACE> TypeReference <WITH> TypeReferenceStoreImpl)
<REPLACE> < <WITH> .)
<REPLACE> Set <WITH> Operations)
<DELETE> < Class < Operation > > > { <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Renamed the method from `fetchOperations` to `getRemoteSupportedOperations`.
     - Removed the `throws StoreException` from the method signature.
     - Replaced `final` with `try` in the method body.
     - Added a `try-catch` block that wraps the method body and throws a `GafferRuntimeException` if a `StoreException` occurs.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Removed the cast to `(Set)`.
     - Replaced `TypeReference<Set<Class<Operation>>>()` with `TypeReferenceStoreImpl.Operations()`.
     - Changed the syntax from generic type declaration to a method reference or nested class.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The method name change (`fetchOperations` â†’ `getRemoteSupportedOperations`) is a logical improvement if the method is intended to return a set of supported operations rather than just fetching them.
     - Removing `throws StoreException` and wrapping the call in a `try-catch` that throws a `GafferRuntimeException` is a good practice for encapsulating exceptions and providing a more user-friendly error message.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Removing the cast to `(Set)` is safe if the `doGet` method already returns the correct type.
     - Replacing the `TypeReference` with a nested class or method reference (`TypeReferenceStoreImpl.Operations()`) is likely an optimization or refactoring to improve code readability or reuse.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** aims to improve error handling and method naming to better reflect the method's purpose.
   - **Branch b** aims to simplify the code by removing unnecessary casting and using a more concise or reusable type reference.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method name `getRemoteSupportedOperations` is more descriptive and should be retained.
   - The `try-catch` block from branch a should be kept to handle exceptions gracefully.
   - The cast to `(Set)` from branch a can be removed in favor of the cleaner approach from branch b.
   - The `TypeReferenceStoreImpl.Operations()` from branch b is a better choice for clarity and maintainability.
   - The method should not throw `StoreException` directly but instead wrap it in a `GafferRuntimeException`.

```java
protected Set<Class<? extends Operation>> getRemoteSupportedOperations() {
    try {
        URL url = getProperties().getGafferUrl("graph/operations");
        return Collections.unmodifiableSet(doGet(url, TypeReferenceStoreImpl.Operations(), null));
    } catch (final StoreException e) {
        throw new GafferRuntimeException("Failed to fetch operations from remote store.", e);
    }
}
```
