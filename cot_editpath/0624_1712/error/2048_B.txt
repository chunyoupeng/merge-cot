### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> public void setActiveBitmap ( Bitmap bitmap , boolean clear ) { <newline> mActiveBitmap = bitmap ; <newline> if ( clear ) { <newline> mActiveBitmap . eraseColor ( Color . TRANSPARENT ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> mActiveCanvas = new Canvas ( mActiveBitmap ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>
<ADD> <newline> mUndoBuffer = saveBuffer ( ) ;


## From base to b
<DELETE> public void setActiveBitmap ( Bitmap bitmap , boolean clear ) { <newline> mActiveBitmap = bitmap ; <newline> if ( clear ) { <newline> mActiveBitmap . eraseColor ( Color . TRANSPARENT ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline> mActiveCanvas = new Canvas ( mActiveBitmap ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the `restoreBitmap(Bitmap bitmap, Matrix matrix)` method.
   - Both `a` and `b` have removed the `setActiveBitmap(Bitmap bitmap, boolean clear)` method from the base.
   - Both `a` and `b` have added the line `mUndoBuffer = saveBuffer();` to the `restoreBitmap` method.
   - The only difference between `a` and `b` is the order of the added line `mUndoBuffer = saveBuffer();` in the `restoreBitmap` method. In both cases, the line is added at the end of the method.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The removal of the `setActiveBitmap` method in both `a` and `b` suggests that this method is no longer needed or has been moved elsewhere.
   - The addition of `mUndoBuffer = saveBuffer();` in the `restoreBitmap` method is likely to support an undo functionality by saving the current state of the canvas after a bitmap is drawn.
   - Since both `a` and `b` make the same functional change (adding the same line to the same method), the conflict is not functional but rather a matter of merge order.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` appears to be to enhance the `restoreBitmap` method by adding undo functionality.
   - The removal of `setActiveBitmap` suggests that the logic for setting the active bitmap has been refactored or moved to another part of the codebase.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` add the same line to the same method, the conflict is trivial and can be resolved by choosing one of the versions.
   - The order of the added line at the end of the method is consistent in both branches, so no further modification is needed.
   - The final version should include the added line `mUndoBuffer = saveBuffer();` in the `restoreBitmap` method and exclude the `setActiveBitmap` method.
