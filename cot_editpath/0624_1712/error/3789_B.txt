### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ; <newline> import com . stormpath . sdk . impl . resource . CollectionProperties


## From base to b
<REPLACE> AbstractResource <WITH> *)
<DELETE> <newline> import com . stormpath . sdk . impl . resource . ArrayProperty ; <newline> import com . stormpath . sdk . impl . resource . Property ; <newline> import com . stormpath . sdk . impl . resource . ReferenceFactory ; <newline> import com . stormpath . sdk . impl . resource . ResourceReference ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added an import for `CollectionProperties`.
   - **Branch `b`** replaced the explicit list of imports with a wildcard import (`import com.stormpath.sdk.impl.resource.*;`).
   - **Branch `b`** also removed the explicit imports for `ArrayProperty`, `Property`, `ReferenceFactory`, and `ResourceReference`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Adding `CollectionProperties` is a specific and necessary import for a class that uses it. This change is likely driven by the need to reference `CollectionProperties` in the code.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Using a wildcard import (`*`) is a common practice to reduce boilerplate when many classes from the same package are used. However, it may reduce clarity and could potentially lead to naming conflicts if not managed carefully.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely added the import because the code now uses `CollectionProperties`, and it was missing in the base.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to simplify the import section by reducing the number of lines and using a wildcard, which is a common refactoring for cleaner code when many classes from the same package are used.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The wildcard import from `b` is a clean and concise solution, especially if the code uses many classes from the same package.
   - However, `CollectionProperties` was added in `a`, and if it is used in the code, it must be imported.
   - Since `CollectionProperties` is not included in the wildcard import (`*`), it must be explicitly imported.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the wildcard import from `b` and add the `CollectionProperties` import from `a`.
