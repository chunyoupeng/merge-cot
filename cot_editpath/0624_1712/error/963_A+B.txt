### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two sets of getter and setter methods.
   - **Branch `a`** introduces:
     - `getFtsIri()` and `setFtsIri(IRI ftsIri)`
   - **Branch `b`** introduces:
     - `getLabelIri()` and `setLabelIri(IRI aLabelIri)`
     - `getPropertyTypeIri()` and `setPropertyTypeIri(IRI aPropertyTypeIri)`
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding entirely new code.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** adds a getter and setter for an `ftsIri` field. This likely represents a Full-Text Search IRI, which may be used for search-related functionality.
   - **Branch `b`** adds getters and setters for `labelIri` and `propertyTypeIri`, which likely represent metadata or semantic properties of an object.
   - All methods are logically distinct and serve different purposes. There is no overlap in functionality or naming.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely adding support for full-text search capabilities.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely adding support for metadata or semantic modeling, such as labeling or property typing.
   - Both sets of methods are orthogonal and serve different purposes, so they can coexist without conflict.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of methods are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of methods** into the final code.
   - No method needs to be discarded or modified.
   - The final code should include all four methods: `getFtsIri`, `setFtsIri`, `getLabelIri`, `setLabelIri`, `getPropertyTypeIri`, and `setPropertyTypeIri`.

```java
public IRI getFtsIri()
{
    return ftsIri;
}

public void setFtsIri(IRI ftsIri)
{
    this.ftsIri = ftsIri;
}

public IRI getLabelIri()
{
    return labelIri;
}

public void setLabelIri(IRI aLabelIri)
{
    labelIri = aLabelIri;
}

public IRI getPropertyTypeIri()
{
    return propertyTypeIri;
}

public void setPropertyTypeIri(IRI aPropertyTypeIri)
{
    propertyTypeIri = aPropertyTypeIri;
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public IRI getLabelIri()
    {
        return labelIri;
    }

    public void setLabelIri(IRI aLabelIri)
    {
        labelIri = aLabelIri;
    }

    public IRI getPropertyTypeIri()
    {
        return propertyTypeIri;

    public void setPropertyTypeIri(IRI aPropertyTypeIri)
    {
        propertyTypeIri = aPropertyTypeIri;
    }

    public IRI getFtsIri()
