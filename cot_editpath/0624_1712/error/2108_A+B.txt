### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
*
     * @param triggerDao dao implementation for {@code Trigger}
     * @param threadPoolSize the thread pool size for the scheduler
||||||| base
* @param triggerDao - dao implementation for {@code Trigger}
     * @param threadPoolSize - the thread pool size for the scheduler
=======

     * @param triggerDao     - dao implementation for {@code Trigger}
     * @param threadPoolSize - the thread pool size for the scheduler
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> * <newline>
<DELETE> - -


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the Javadoc parameters are written with hyphens (`-`) for indentation and separation.
   - In branch `a`, the hyphens (`-`) are removed from the parameter descriptions.
   - In branch `b`, the hyphens (`-`) are also removed from the parameter descriptions, but the formatting is slightly different (spaces are used for indentation instead of hyphens).
   - The conflict is about the formatting of the Javadoc parameter descriptions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` aim to remove the hyphens (`-`) from the parameter descriptions, which is a stylistic change.
   - The intention appears to be to modernize or clean up the Javadoc formatting, possibly to align with a new code style or tooling preference.
   - The difference between `a` and `b` is in the indentation: `a` uses a single `*` and a newline, while `b` uses a `*` followed by spaces for indentation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` is to improve the Javadoc formatting by removing the hyphens and using a cleaner style.
   - The difference in indentation (`a` vs. `b`) is likely due to different formatting preferences or tools used in each branch.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` aim to remove the hyphens, the key is to choose a consistent and clean formatting style.
   - The version in `b` uses consistent spacing and indentation, which is more readable and commonly used in modern Javadoc formatting.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the formatting from `b` to ensure consistency and readability.
