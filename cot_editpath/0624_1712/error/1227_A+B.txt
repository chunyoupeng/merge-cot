### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict arises because both branches `a` and `b` added new key-value pairs to a resource file (likely a localization or configuration file).
   - Branch `a` added two entries related to SSL protocols:
     - `"R_sslProtocolPropertyDescription"`: Describes the SSL protocol options.
     - `"R_invalidSSLProtocol"`: Error message for invalid SSL protocol.
   - Branch `b` added four entries related to SQL_VARIANT data type support:
     - `"R_SQLVariantSupport"`: Describes lack of support for SQL_VARIANT in older SQL versions.
     - `"R_invalidProbbytes"`: Error message for invalid probBytes.
     - `"R_invalidStringValue"`: Error message for string length limit.
     - `"R_invalidValueForTVPWithSQLVariant"`: Error message for inserting null values in TVP with SQL_VARIANT.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of changes are valid and address different concerns:
     - `a` is focused on SSL protocol validation and description.
     - `b` is focused on SQL_VARIANT data type limitations and error handling.
   - There is no overlap in the keys or the functionality they represent.
   - Both sets of changes are likely required in the final merged code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to enhance SSL protocol handling and provide user-friendly messages for invalid protocol inputs.
   - The intention of `b` is to add support for SQL_VARIANT-related error messages and constraints, likely for a database-related feature or validation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the changes are non-conflicting and address different aspects of the application, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of changes**.
   - The order of the entries may be preserved as in the original branches, or sorted alphabetically for consistency, depending on the project's style guide.
   - No changes need to be discarded or modified.
