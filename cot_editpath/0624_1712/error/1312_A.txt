### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

     * @param resource
     *            A steam containing a zip file which contains six compressed textures.
     *            The six textures correspond to +x, -x, +y, -y, +z, and -z faces of
     *            the cube map texture respectively. The default names of the
     *            six images are "posx.pkm", "negx.pkm", "posy.pkm", "negx.pkm",
     *            "posz.pkm", and "negz.pkm", which can be changed by calling
     *            {@link GVRCubemapTexture#setFaceNames(String[])}.

     *             <p>
     *             It's fairly common for multiple scene objects to use the same
     *             texture or the same mesh. Thus, if you try to load, say,
     *             {@code R.raw.whatever} while you already have a pending
     *             request for {@code R.raw.whatever}, it will only be loaded
     *             once; the same resource will be used to satisfy both (all)
     *             requests. This "consolidation" uses
     *             {@link GVRAndroidResource#equals(Object)}, <em>not</em>
     *             {@code ==} (aka "reference equality"): The problem with using
     *             the same resource descriptor is that if requests can't be
     *             consolidated (because the later one(s) came in after the
     *             earlier one(s) had already completed) the resource will be
     *             reloaded ... but the original descriptor will have been
     *             closed.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
