### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Adds the following imports:
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventListener;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventMessage;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.ListenerInvocationErrorHandler;`
     - Also includes a `<REPLACE>` operation that likely modifies a token (possibly a class or method name) to `EventBus`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Adds the following imports:
       - `import org.axonframework.deadline.annotation.DeadlineMethodMessageHandlerDefinition;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventHandler;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventListener;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.EventMessage;`
       - `import org.axonframework.eventhandling.ListenerInvocationErrorHandler;`
     - Also includes a `<REPLACE>` operation similar to `a`, likely modifying the same token to `EventBus`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `a` and `b` are adding the same set of imports related to event handling in Axon.
   - The only difference is that `b` also adds an import for `DeadlineMethodMessageHandlerDefinition`, which is related to Axon's deadline handling mechanism.
   - The `<REPLACE>` operation in both branches likely refers to a token-level change (e.g., renaming a class or method to `EventBus`), which is the same in both branches.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be focused on event handling and error handling in Axon, likely for a feature that uses `EventBus`, `EventHandler`, and related components.
   - **Branch `b`** is doing the same as `a` but also introduces a deadline-related import, suggesting it may be adding functionality for handling deadlines in addition to event handling.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both `a` and `b` are adding the same imports for event handling, and `b` adds an additional import for deadline handling, the most logical resolution is to include all the imports from both branches.
   - The `<REPLACE>` operation is the same in both branches, so it should be applied once.
   - The final import list should include all the imports from both branches to ensure both event and deadline handling are supported.
