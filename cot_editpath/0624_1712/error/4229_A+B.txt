### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> Map < String , Model > models = new LinkedHashMap < String , Model > ( ) ; <newline> <newline> models . putAll ( apiModelReader . read ( each . withKnownModels ( models ) ) ) ;


## From base to b
<ADD> List < RequestMappingContext > requestMappings = nullToEmptyList ( requestMappingsByResourceGroup . get ( resourceGroup ) ) ; <newline>
<REPLACE> requestMappingsByResourceGroup <WITH> requestMappings)
<DELETE> . get ( resourceGroup )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the line `Map<String, Model> models = new LinkedHashMap<String, Model>();` and the `models.putAll(...)` call from inside the loop.
     - This suggests that `a` is trying to simplify or optimize the code by removing the `models` map and directly using `apiModelReader.read(...)` without storing the result in a map.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduced a new variable `requestMappings` to store the result of `nullToEmptyList(requestMappingsByResourceGroup.get(resourceGroup))`.
     - Replaced `requestMappingsByResourceGroup.get(resourceGroup)` with `requestMappings` in the for loop.
     - This suggests that `b` is trying to improve readability and null safety by avoiding repeated calls to `get(resourceGroup)` and using a more descriptive variable name.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - The removal of the `models` map and the `putAll` call may be problematic if the `models` map is used elsewhere in the code or if the `apiModelReader.read(...)` method relies on the `models` map being populated.
     - However, if the `models` map is not used elsewhere, this change could be a valid optimization.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The introduction of `requestMappings` improves readability and null safety by avoiding repeated calls to `get(resourceGroup)`.
     - This change is generally safe and beneficial.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention appears to be to simplify the code by removing the `models` map and the `putAll` call.
     - This could be done if the `models` map is not needed elsewhere in the code.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention appears to be to improve readability and null safety by introducing a new variable and avoiding repeated calls to `get(resourceGroup)`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `b` is generally safe and beneficial, as it improves readability and null safety.
   - The change in `a` may be problematic if the `models` map is used elsewhere in the code.
   - Since the `models` map is used in the `apiModelReader.read(...)` call, it is likely needed and should be kept.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the `models` map and the `putAll` call from `base` and incorporate the change from `b` to improve readability and null safety.

# Final resolution

```java
Map<String, Model> models = new LinkedHashMap<String, Model>();
      List<RequestMappingContext> requestMappings = nullToEmptyList(requestMappingsByResourceGroup.get(resourceGroup));
      for (RequestMappingContext each : sortedByMethods(requestMappings)) {
        models.putAll(apiModelReader.read(each.withKnownModels(models)));
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
List<RequestMappingContext> requestMappings = nullToEmptyList(requestMappingsByResourceGroup.get(resourceGroup));
      for (RequestMappingContext each : sortedByMethods(requestMappings)) {
