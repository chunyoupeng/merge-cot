### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
case "SortedMap":
        return "emptySortedMap";
      case "NavigableMap":
        return "emptyNavigableMap";
||||||| base

=======
case "Collection":
        return "emptyList";
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in a switch-case block where both branches `a` and `b` have added their own `case` statements.
   - In `a`, the added code is:
     ```java
     case "SortedMap":
         return "emptySortedMap";
     case "NavigableMap":
         return "emptyNavigableMap";
     ```
   - In `b`, the added code is:
     ```java
     case "Collection":
         return "emptyList";
     ```
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own `case` statements.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a` added support for `SortedMap` and `NavigableMap`, returning appropriate empty implementations.
   - `b` added support for `Collection`, returning an empty list.
   - All three types (`Collection`, `SortedMap`, `NavigableMap`) are distinct and valid Java interfaces, and their handling is logically consistent with the pattern of returning an appropriate empty implementation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of both `a` and `b` appears to be to extend the switch-case block to handle more types by returning their corresponding empty implementations.
   - There is no overlap or contradiction between the added `case` statements.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the changes from both branches are additive and do not conflict with each other, the best resolution is to merge all three `case` statements into the final code.
   - This preserves the functionality and intent of both branches without any loss or duplication.

### Gold (Ground Truth)
case "SortedMap":
        return "emptySortedMap";
      case "NavigableMap":
        return "emptyNavigableMap";
      case "Collection":
        return "emptyList";
