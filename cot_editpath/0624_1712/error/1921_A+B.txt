### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a

||||||| base
import us.ihmc.robotics.geometry.FramePoint;
import us.ihmc.robotics.geometry.FramePoint2d;
=======
import us.ihmc.robotics.geometry.FramePoint;
import us.ihmc.robotics.geometry.FramePoint2d;
import us.ihmc.robotics.geometry.FrameVector;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> import us . ihmc . robotics . geometry . FrameVector ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import section of the file.
   - `a` has removed all content from the base, which includes the original import statements.
   - `b` has added a new import statement for `FrameVector` while keeping the original imports from the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `a`'s change is a complete removal of the file's content, which is likely a mistake or a placeholder for a larger refactor. This change is not useful for resolving the conflict unless there is additional context.
   - `b`'s change is a minimal and logical addition of a new import statement for `FrameVector`, which is likely needed for new functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is unclear due to the complete removal of content. It could be a placeholder or a mistake.
   - The intention of `b` is to add the `FrameVector` import, which is a common and reasonable addition in a robotics geometry context.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a`'s change removes all content, it is not useful for resolving the conflict.
   - `b`'s change is a valid and necessary addition.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the original imports from the base and add the new import from `b`.
