### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* @param streamDefinition       The stream definition
||||||| base
*  @param streamDefinition       The stream definition
=======
*
     * @param streamDefinition       The stream definition
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the line is: `*  @param streamDefinition       The stream definition`
   - In branch `a`, the line is: `* @param streamDefinition       The stream definition`
     - The only change is the removal of a space before `@param`.
   - In branch `b`, the line is: `* <newline> * @param streamDefinition       The stream definition`
     - A new line with `*` is added before the `@param` line.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** It removes an extra space before `@param`, which is likely a formatting cleanup to align with standard Javadoc style (`* @param`).
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** It adds a new line with `*`, which could be an attempt to add a new Javadoc line before the `@param` line. However, the added line is just `*` with no content, which is likely an error or incomplete addition.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** Improve code formatting by removing unnecessary whitespace.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** Possibly to insert a new line in the Javadoc, but the implementation is incomplete or incorrect.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Branch `a`'s change is valid and improves formatting.
   - Branch `b`'s change appears to be incomplete or incorrect and should be discarded.
   - The correct resolution is to adopt the formatting from branch `a` and ignore the incomplete addition from branch `b`.
