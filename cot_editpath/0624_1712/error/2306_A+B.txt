### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in a comment block and a commented-out exception throw statement.
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced all `*` comment markers with `/` or `//`, effectively converting block comments to line comments.
     - Added additional `//` lines.
     - Removed a `*` comment line.
     - Changed `JsonMappingException` to `XxxException` in the throw statement.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Removed the phrase `, as per [JACKSON-388]` from the comment.
     - Also changed `JsonMappingException` to `XxxException` in the throw statement.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes**:
     - The conversion of block comments to line comments is a stylistic change. It may be done to align with a different code formatting standard.
     - The removal of a comment line might be to clean up or simplify the comment.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes**:
     - Removing the reference to the issue `[JACKSON-388]` removes context about the reason for the decision. This could be useful for future developers to understand the rationale.
     - The change to `XxxException` is likely a placeholder or a refactor to a different exception type.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be focused on code formatting and possibly preparing the code for a different style guide or tooling.
   - **Branch `b`** seems to be focused on simplifying the comment by removing the reference to the issue, possibly to reduce noise or because the issue is no longer relevant.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The formatting change in `a` is a minor stylistic change and can be preserved if the team prefers line comments.
   - The removal of the issue reference in `b` removes useful context, so it should be preserved from `a`.
   - The change to `XxxException` is consistent in both branches, so it should be kept.
   - The overall goal is to preserve the comment's clarity and usefulness while aligning with the formatting style.
