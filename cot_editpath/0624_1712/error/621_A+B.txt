### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> private List < MessageOfTheDayInfo > getMessages ( ) { <newline> return this . messages . stream ( ) <newline> . filter ( motd - > ! Strings . isNullOrEmpty ( motd . getHtmlMessage ( ) ) ) <newline> . map ( <newline> motd - > { <newline> MessageOfTheDayInfo m = new MessageOfTheDayInfo ( ) ; <newline> m . id = motd . getMessageId ( ) ; <newline> m . redisplay = motd . getRedisplay ( ) ; <newline> m . html = motd . getHtmlMessage ( ) ; <newline> return m ; <newline> } ) <newline> . collect ( toList ( ) ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed all content from the base. This means the `getMessages()` method and the `isNoteDbEnabled()` method were both deleted.
   - **Branch `b`** added the `getMessages()` method, which filters and transforms messages into `MessageOfTheDayInfo` objects. It also retained the `isNoteDbEnabled()` method from the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Removing all content is a drastic action. It likely indicates that the code in the base is no longer needed or is being replaced entirely. However, without context, it's unclear if this removal is intentional or accidental.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** The `getMessages()` method is a new addition that provides a clear transformation of messages into a specific format. It is well-structured and logically sound. The `isNoteDbEnabled()` method is retained, which is consistent with the base.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** It appears that the intention is to remove all existing functionality, possibly to replace it with something else. However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact reason for the removal.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** The intention is to add a new method that processes messages into a specific format. This is a clear and useful addition to the codebase.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` removed all content, including the `getMessages()` method, and branch `b` added the `getMessages()` method, the most logical resolution is to keep the `getMessages()` method from branch `b` and discard the removal from branch `a`. The `isNoteDbEnabled()` method from the base is retained as it is not removed in branch `b`.

# Final resolution
```java
private List<MessageOfTheDayInfo> getMessages() {
    return this.messages.stream()
        .filter(motd -> !Strings.isNullOrEmpty(motd.getHtmlMessage()))
        .map(
            motd -> {
              MessageOfTheDayInfo m = new MessageOfTheDayInfo();
              m.id = motd.getMessageId();
              m.redisplay = motd.getRedisplay();
              m.html = motd.getHtmlMessage();
              return m;
            })
        .collect(toList());
  }

  private boolean isNoteDbEnabled() {
    return migration.readChanges();
  }
```

        .filter(motd -> !Strings.isNullOrEmpty(motd.getHtmlMessage()))
        .map(
            motd -> {
              MessageOfTheDayInfo m = new MessageOfTheDayInfo();
              m.id = motd.getMessageId();
              m.redisplay = motd.getRedisplay();
              m.html = motd.getHtmlMessage();
