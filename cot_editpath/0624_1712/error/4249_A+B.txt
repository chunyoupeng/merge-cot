### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the `PACKET_STREAMING_ENABLED` conditional logic and replaced it with a direct implementation of the read logic using `mAlluxioFileInputStream` and `mHdfsInputStream`.
     - Introduced a new conditional logic that checks if `mAlluxioFileInputStream` is not null and uses it; otherwise, it calls `getHdfsInputStream()` and uses `mHdfsInputStream`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced the logic in `readWithPacketStreaming` with a call to `mInputStream.positionedRead(...)`, which suggests a refactoring to use a single stream (`mInputStream`) instead of conditionally choosing between `mAlluxioFileInputStream` and `mHdfsInputStream`.
     - Removed the `if (mAlluxioFileInputStream != null)` block entirely.

2. **Evaluate each change

### Gold (Ground Truth)
int bytesRead = mInputStream.positionedRead(position, buffer, offset, length);

### Diff Type
A+B

### Note: No code block found in the prediction.
