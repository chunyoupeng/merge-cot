### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

if (!requestWithState.getRequest().isLongRunning()) {
      throw WebExceptions.badRequest("Can not bounce a %s request (%s)", requestWithState.getRequest().getRequestType(), requestWithState);
    }
||||||| base
if (!requestWithState.getRequest().isLongRunning()) {
      throw WebExceptions.badRequest("Can not bounce a scheduled or one-off request (%s)", requestWithState);
    }
=======
checkBadRequest(requestWithState.getRequest().isLongRunning(), "Can not bounce a scheduled or one-off request (%s)", requestWithState);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> scheduled <WITH> %)
<REPLACE> or <WITH> s)
<DELETE> one - off
<ADD> . getRequest ( ) . getRequestType ( ) , requestWithState


## From base to b
<REPLACE> if <WITH> checkBadRequest)
<DELETE> !
<REPLACE> ) <WITH> ,)
<DELETE> { <newline> throw WebExceptions . badRequest ( <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Replaces "scheduled or one-off" with a dynamic message that includes `getRequestType()`.
     - This allows the error message to be more specific to the type of request.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Replaces the `if` condition with a call to `checkBadRequest`, which likely encapsulates the logic for checking and throwing an error.
     - Removes the negation (`!`) and modifies the syntax to fit the new function call.
     - This is a refactoring to reduce boilerplate and centralize error-checking logic.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The dynamic message is more informative and context-aware, which is a good improvement for debugging and user clarity.
     - However, it introduces a more complex string formatting.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - The use of `checkBadRequest` is a clean and maintainable approach, reducing code duplication.
     - It abstracts the error-checking logic, which is a good design practice.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve the clarity and specificity of the error message.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to refactor the code for better maintainability and abstraction.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The intention of both branches is complementary: `a` improves the message, and `b` improves the structure.
   - The best resolution is to combine both: use `checkBadRequest` for abstraction and pass the dynamic message from `a` to it.
   - This way, we retain the benefits of both branches: maintainability and clarity.
