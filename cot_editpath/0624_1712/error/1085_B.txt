### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<REPLACE> currentTerms <WITH> query)
<DELETE> <newline> * @ param substitutions


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the method `pullOutEqualities(CQIE query)`.
   - In the base version, the method includes a parameter `currentTerms` and `substitutions` as a parameter.
   - In branch `a`, the method has been completely removed and replaced with a new version that no longer includes the `currentTerms` and `substitutions` parameters.
   - In branch `b`, the method is modified by:
     - Replacing `currentTerms` with `query)` (likely a typo or formatting error).
     - Removing the parameter `substitutions` from the Javadoc.
     - The rest of the method remains the same as in the base.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The method is completely rewritten, removing the `currentTerms` and `substitutions` parameters. This suggests a significant refactoring or simplification of the method's logic.
   - **Branch `b`:** The method is slightly modified, removing the `currentTerms` parameter and updating the Javadoc. This suggests a minor cleanup or correction.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention appears to be a complete refactoring of the method to simplify or restructure it.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention appears to be a minor cleanup or correction of the method's parameters and Javadoc.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` has completely rewritten the method and removed the `currentTerms` and `substitutions` parameters, it is likely that the changes in branch `b` are redundant or incorrect.
   - The method in branch `a` is more likely to be the correct and complete version of the method.
   - Therefore, the changes from branch `a` should be kept, and the changes from branch `b` should be discarded.
