### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public void addAnnotation(Map<String, Object> annotation, Presentation presentation) {
||||||| base
public void addShape(Shape shape, Presentation presentation) {
=======
public void addShape(ShapeGraphic shape, Presentation presentation) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> addShape <WITH> addAnnotation)
<REPLACE> Shape <WITH> Map)
<REPLACE> shape <WITH> <)
<ADD> String , Object > annotation


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Shape <WITH> ShapeGraphic)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method is `addShape(Shape shape, Presentation presentation)`.
   - In branch `a`, the method is renamed to `addAnnotation(Map<String, Object> annotation, Presentation presentation)`. The parameter type is changed from `Shape` to `Map<String, Object>`, and the method name reflects a shift from adding a shape to adding an annotation.
   - In branch `b`, the method remains `addShape`, but the parameter type is changed from `Shape` to `ShapeGraphic`, indicating a more specific or enhanced shape representation.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a significant semantic change: it shifts the method's purpose from adding a shape to adding an annotation. This is a more abstract and flexible approach, allowing for arbitrary key-value pairs to be added as annotations.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces a more specific type (`ShapeGraphic`) for the shape parameter. This could indicate a design decision to use a more detailed or enhanced shape representation, possibly for rendering or additional functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to generalize the method to support annotations, which are often used for metadata or additional information.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to refine the shape type to a more specific or enhanced version, possibly for improved rendering or behavior.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The two branches have different intentions: one generalizes the method to support annotations, while the other refines the shape type.
   - Since both changes are semantically distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to **create two separate methods**:
     - One method for adding annotations (`addAnnotation`) with a `Map<String, Object>` parameter.
     - One method for adding shapes (`addShape`) with a `ShapeGraphic` parameter.
   - This approach preserves both functionalities and avoids conflict by separating concerns.
