### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
private String accessToken = null;
||||||| base

=======
private String oauthToken = null;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the conflict, both branches `a` and `b` have introduced a new variable declaration in the same location.
   - Branch `a` declares a `private String accessToken = null;`.
   - Branch `b` declares a `private String oauthToken = null;`.
   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding new content at the same position.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `accessToken` and `oauthToken` are semantically similar in that they likely represent authentication tokens.
   - The names differ: `accessToken` is more general, while `oauthToken` is more specific to OAuth protocols.
   - Since both are `null`-initialized, there is no functional conflict at this point.
   - However, the names suggest different intentions or contexts.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` may be implementing a general-purpose token mechanism.
   - Branch `b` may be implementing an OAuth-specific token mechanism.
   - The names reflect these intentions.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both variables are logically distinct (one is a general token, the other is OAuth-specific), it is reasonable to keep both.
   - However, if the codebase only needs one token variable, the choice between `accessToken` and `oauthToken` depends on the broader context.
   - Given no further context, the safer and more inclusive resolution is to keep both variables with distinct names to avoid overwriting either change.

```java
private String accessToken = null;
private String oauthToken = null;
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
