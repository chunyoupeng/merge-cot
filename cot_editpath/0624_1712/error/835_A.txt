### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> Normal <WITH> NORMAL)
<REPLACE> notShown <WITH> NOTSHOWN)
<ADD> <newline> <newline> ArrayList < EnumSet < RPPA > > RPPAsortOrder = new ArrayList < EnumSet < RPPA > > ( ) ; <newline> RPPAsortOrder . add ( EnumSet . of ( RPPA . UPREGULATED ) ) ; <newline> RPPAsortOrder . add ( EnumSet . of ( RPPA . DOWNREGULATED ) ) ; <newline> <newline> / / combined because these are represented by the same color in the OncoPrint <newline> RPPAsortOrder . add ( EnumSet . of ( RPPA . NORMAL , RPPA . NOTSHOWN ) ) ;


## From base to b
<REPLACE> Normal <WITH> NORMAL)
<REPLACE> notShown <WITH> NOTSHOWN)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `Normal` with `NORMAL`.
     - Replaced `notShown` with `NOTSHOWN`.
     - Added a new block of code to define and populate an `RPPAsortOrder` list with `EnumSet` values for `RPPA.UPREGULATED`, `RPPA.DOWNREGULATED`, and a combined `RPPA.NORMAL` and `RPPA.NOTSHOWN`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Only replaced `Normal` with `NORMAL` and `notShown` with `NOTSHOWN`.
     - No new code was added.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both branches `a` and `b` made the same replacements for `Normal` and `notShown` to match the uppercase enum constants (`NORMAL`, `NOTSHOWN`). This is a standard practice in Java for enum constants and is likely a code style or consistency fix.
   - Branch `a` introduced a new block of code for `RPPAsortOrder`, which is not present in `b`. This suggests that `a` is adding new functionality related to sorting or categorizing RPPA data.
   - Since `b` only made the enum constant replacements and did not add any new logic, it appears to be a simpler or more conservative change.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both branches is to standardize the enum constant names (`NORMAL`, `NOTSHOWN`) for consistency with Java conventions.
   - The intention in `a` is to also add new sorting logic for RPPA data, which is not present in `b`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The enum constant name changes (`NORMAL`, `NOTSHOWN`) are consistent across both branches and should be kept.
   - The new `RPPAsortOrder` logic from `a` is a meaningful addition that introduces new functionality and should be retained.
   - Since `b` does not conflict with the new logic from `a`, the resolution is to merge the changes from `a` into the base, including both the enum constant updates and the new `RPPAsortOrder` logic.
