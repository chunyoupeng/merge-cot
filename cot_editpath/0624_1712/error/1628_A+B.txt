### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different methods added by branches `a` and `b` to an otherwise empty base.
   - **Branch a** introduces a method `pushImageTag` that pushes specific image tags to a Docker registry. It includes validation for the `imageTags` list and iterates over them to push each one.
   - **Branch b** introduces a method `writeImageInfoFile` and a helper class `DigestExtractingProgressHandler`. The method writes Docker build information to a file, and the helper class captures the digest from Docker progress messages.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's method** is focused on Docker image management, specifically pushing specific tags. This is a core functionality for a Docker-related Maven plugin.
   - **Branch b's method** is focused on logging and storing Docker build information, which is also a valid and useful feature for tracking and debugging.
   - Both changes are non-conflicting in terms of code structure since they are entirely separate methods and classes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** aims to provide granular control over Docker image tagging and pushing, which is essential for CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Branch b** aims to enhance traceability and debugging by capturing and storing Docker build metadata.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to **merge both changes** into the final codebase.
   - No code from either branch needs to be discarded or modified, as they do not interfere with each other.
   - The final code should include both the `pushImageTag` method from branch `a` and the `writeImageInfoFile` method and `DigestExtractingProgressHandler` class from branch `b`.
