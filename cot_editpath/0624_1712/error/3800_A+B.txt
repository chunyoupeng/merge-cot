### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different methods added in branches `a` and `b`.
   - Branch `a` introduces a method `addTeleport(TeleportCache teleportCache)` that manages a map of teleport caches and removes outdated entries.
   - Branch `b` introduces two methods related to inventory tasks: `addInventoryTask(Runnable task)` and `addInventoryTask(Runnable task, long delayMillis)`. These methods manage a sequence of inventory tasks, either immediately or with a delay.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. The `addTeleport` method is for managing teleport-related data, while the `addInventoryTask` methods are for managing inventory-related tasks.
   - Neither method is a direct modification of the other, and they do not share overlapping functionality or data structures.
   - There is no logical conflict between the two sets of changes, as they operate on different parts of the system.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of branch `a` is to handle teleport confirmation IDs and ensure that only the most recent teleport is retained.
   - The intention of branch `b` is to provide a mechanism for scheduling and executing inventory tasks in a controlled, sequential manner.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of changes are independent and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both methods into the final code.
   - No modifications are needed to either method, as they do not interfere with each other.
   - The final code should include both the teleport management logic and the inventory task scheduling logic.
