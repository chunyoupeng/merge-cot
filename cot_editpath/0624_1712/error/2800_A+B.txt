### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

Result getConsensusConfig(Map<String,Object> params);
||||||| base
Result getSeedNodeList(Map<String,Object> params);

Result getSeedNodeList(Map<String,Object> params);

    Result getAgentChangeInfo(Map<String,Object> params);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> getSeedNodeList <WITH> getConsensusConfig)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> / * * <newline> * 获取共识两轮次间节点变化信息 <newline> * @ param params <newline> * @ return Result <newline> * * / <newline> Result getAgentChangeInfo ( Map < String , Object > params ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, there is a method `getSeedNodeList(Map<String,Object> params);`.
   - In branch `a`, the method `getSeedNodeList` has been **replaced** with `getConsensusConfig`.
   - In branch `b`, a **new method** `getAgentChangeInfo` has been added below `getSeedNodeList`, with a detailed JavaDoc comment describing it as a method to retrieve node change information between consensus rounds.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is renaming a method from `getSeedNodeList` to `getConsensusConfig`. This suggests a shift in the method's purpose or naming convention to better reflect its role in a consensus-related configuration.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding a new method `getAgentChangeInfo` to provide additional functionality related to consensus rounds. This is a non-conflicting addition in terms of code structure, but it overlaps thematically with the changes in `a`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to **refactor or rename** the method to better align with the system's evolving architecture or naming conventions.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to **extend functionality** by introducing a new method to retrieve node change information between consensus rounds, which is a logical addition to the existing consensus-related code.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method renaming in `a` is a structural change that should be preserved if the new name better reflects the method's purpose.
   - The addition in `b` is a new feature that should be preserved as it adds value and does not conflict with the renamed method from `a`.
   - Therefore, the resolution should **keep both changes**: rename the method to `getConsensusConfig` and add the new method `getAgentChangeInfo`.

```java
Result getConsensusConfig(Map<String,Object> params);

    /**
     * 获取共识两轮次间节点变化信息
     * @param params
     * @return Result
     * */
    Result getAgentChangeInfo(Map<String,Object> params);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
Result getConsensusConfig(Map<String,Object> params);

    Result getSeedNodeList(Map<String,Object> params);

    /**
     * 获取共识两轮次间节点变化信息
     * @param params
     * @return Result
     * */
    Result getAgentChangeInfo(Map<String,Object> params);
