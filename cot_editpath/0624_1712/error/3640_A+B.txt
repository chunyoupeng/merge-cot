### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Replaced `String location` with `HostAndPort server`.
     - Replaced `SslConnectionParams sslParams` with `ClientContext context`.
     - Replaced `ArgumentChecker.notNull(location);` with `checkNotNull(server, "location is null");`.
     - Removed the logic that splits the location string into host and port.
     - Removed the error handling for invalid location format.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Added `@VisibleForTesting` annotation.
     - Added `public` visibility to the constructor.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The change from `String location` to `HostAndPort server` is a significant improvement in type safety and clarity. `HostAndPort` likely encapsulates both host and port in a single object, eliminating the need for parsing.
     - Replacing `SslConnectionParams` with `ClientContext` suggests a broader context is now being passed, which may be necessary for the new logic.
     - The replacement of `ArgumentChecker.notNull` with `checkNotNull` is likely a style or utility change, but the intent is the same.
     - Removing the parsing logic and error handling is appropriate if `HostAndPort` is guaranteed to contain both host and port.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Adding `@VisibleForTesting` is a good practice for testability.
     - Adding `public` visibility is also a good practice if the constructor is intended to be used outside the class.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The intention is to simplify the constructor by using a more structured `HostAndPort` object instead of parsing a string.
     - The constructor is likely being refactored to be more robust and type-safe.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The intention is to make the constructor more testable and accessible.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in **branch a** are more substantial and likely represent a refactoring of the constructor to use a better data structure (`HostAndPort`).
   - The changes in **branch b** are complementary and should be applied on top of the changes from **branch a**.
   - The `@VisibleForTesting` and `public` visibility should be added to the constructor from **branch a** to ensure it is testable and accessible.

# Final Resolution

```java
@VisibleForTesting
public ThriftTransportKey(HostAndPort server, long timeout, ClientContext context) {
    checkNotNull(server, "location is null");
    this.server = server;
}
```
