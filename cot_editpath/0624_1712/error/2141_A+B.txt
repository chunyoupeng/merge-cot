### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> * <newline>
<REPLACE> 2015 <WITH> 2014)
<DELETE> <newline> * <newline> *
<ADD> <newline> *
<DELETE> <newline> * <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> < p / >


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the newline after the copyright line.
     - Changed the year from 2015 to 2014.
     - Removed the line `* <newline> * <newline> *` and replaced it with a single `* <newline>`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a paragraph tag `<p/>` after the copyright line.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The year change from 2015 to 2014 suggests that the project was frozen or no longer maintained in 2015.
     - The formatting changes (removing newlines and combining lines) aim to simplify or clean up the comment block.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The addition of `<p/>` is likely an attempt to improve readability or formatting in the documentation, possibly for HTML rendering.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to reflect the end of active development and simplify the comment block.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to enhance the visual formatting of the comment block, possibly for documentation or display purposes.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The year change in `a` is significant and likely reflects the actual status of the project.
   - The `<p/>` tag from `b` can be retained if the formatting is desired, but it should be placed appropriately.
   - The formatting in `a` is cleaner and more concise, so it should be used as the base for the final resolution.
   - The final resolution should reflect the year change from `a`, retain the `<p/>` tag from `b` if appropriate, and maintain a clean and readable format.
