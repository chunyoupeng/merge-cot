### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Adds `public boolean skipDeleted = true;` with a comment.
     - Adds `protected boolean hasLifeCycleWhereClause = false;`.
     - Adds `protected boolean hasMixinTypeWhereClause = false;`.
     - Keeps `public FulltextMatchInfo fulltextMatchInfo;`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Changes `public FulltextMatchInfo fulltextMatchInfo;` to `protected FulltextMatchInfo fulltextMatchInfo;`.
     - Adds two new `Map` fields with comments: `qualifierToType` and `canonicalQualifier`.

   The main conflict is on the `fulltextMatchInfo` field: `a` keeps it `public`, while `b` changes it to `protected`. Additionally, both branches add new fields, but in different parts of the code.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - Introduces flags (`skipDeleted`, `hasLifeCycleWhereClause`, `hasMixinTypeWhereClause`) that likely control query behavior.
     - These are `protected`, which is a reasonable access level for internal use.
     - Keeps `fulltextMatchInfo` as `public`, which may be intentional for external access.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Restricts `fulltextMatchInfo` to `protected`, possibly to encapsulate it better.
     - Adds two `Map` fields with descriptive comments, which likely support query qualification and correlation logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be adding control flags for query behavior and maintaining external access to `fulltextMatchInfo`.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely encapsulating `fulltextMatchInfo` and adding support for qualifier mapping, which is a more internal concern.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The access level of `fulltextMatchInfo` is a key conflict. If the class is intended to be used externally, keeping it `public` is appropriate. If encapsulation is a priority, `protected` is better.
   - Since both branches add new fields, and the fields are in different parts of the class, they can coexist.
   - A reasonable resolution is to keep `fulltextMatchInfo` as `protected` (as in `b`) for encapsulation, while including all the new flags and maps from both branches.
   - The flags from `a` are `protected`, which aligns with the access level of the new fields in `b`.
