### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> import com . b2international . snowowl . snomed . datastore . request . rf2 . validation . AbstractRf2RowValidator ; <newline> import com . b2international . snowowl . snomed . datastore . request . rf2 . validation .

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements at the top of the file.
   - **Branch `a`** has removed all content from the base, which includes the original import statements.
   - **Branch `b`** has added three new import statements:
     - `import com.b2international.snowowl.snomed.datastore.request.rf2.validation.AbstractRf2RowValidator;`
     - `import com.b2international.snowowl.snomed.datastore.request.rf2.validation.Rf2DescriptionTypeRefSetRowValidator;`
     - `import com.b2international.snowowl.snomed.datastore.request.rf2.validation.Rf2ValidationIssueReporter;`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** has removed all content, which is a drastic change. This suggests that `a` may be completely rewriting the file or removing it. However, without more context, it's unclear if this is intentional or a mistake.
   - **Branch `b`** has added specific imports related to RF2 validation, which seems to be a logical and targeted addition. These imports are likely needed for implementing or extending validation functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** appears to be removing the file or its content entirely, possibly for a complete rewrite or removal.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding imports to support validation logic, which is a common and reasonable task in software development.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a` has removed all content, it's unclear whether the file should be kept or removed. However, if the file is still needed, the imports added by `b` are likely necessary for the file's functionality.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include the imports added by `b`, assuming the file is to be retained.
