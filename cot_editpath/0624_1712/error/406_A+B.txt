### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> HighLevelStateChangePacket <WITH> EuclideanWaypointMessage)
<REPLACE> HighLevelStatePacket <WITH> HighLevelStateChangeMessage)
<ADD> humanoidRobotics .
<REPLACE> InvalidPacketNotificationPacket <WITH> HighLevelStateMessage)


## From base to b
<ADD> import us . ihmc . humanoidRobotics . communication . packets . EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage ; <newline>
<DELETE> <newline> import us . ihmc . communication . packets . InvalidPacketNotificationPacket ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is in the import statements.
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced `HighLevelStateChangePacket` with `EuclideanWaypointMessage`.
     - Replaced `HighLevelStatePacket` with `HighLevelStateChangeMessage`.
     - Added `humanoidRobotics` to the package path (likely to fix a missing part).
     - Replaced `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` with `HighLevelStateMessage`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added `import us.ihmc.humanoidRobotics.communication.packets.EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage;`.
     - Removed `import us.ihmc.communication.packets.InvalidPacketNotificationPacket;`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The replacement of `HighLevelStateChangePacket` with `EuclideanWaypointMessage` and `HighLevelStatePacket` with `HighLevelStateChangeMessage` suggests a reorganization or renaming of message types.
     - The addition of `humanoidRobotics` in the package path likely fixes a missing part of the import.
     - Replacing `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` with `HighLevelStateMessage` may indicate a shift in the message types being used.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Adding `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage` is a new import that likely supports a new feature or functionality.
     - Removing `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket` suggests that this message is no longer needed in the context of `b`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to be refactoring or renaming message types, possibly to align with a new naming convention or to replace deprecated types.
   - **Branch `b`** is adding a new message type (`EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage`) and removing an unused or irrelevant one (`InvalidPacketNotificationPacket`).

4. **Final decision:**
   - The goal is to merge both sets of changes without conflict.
   - From `a`, we should keep the renamed imports (`EuclideanWaypointMessage`, `HighLevelStateChangeMessage`, `HighLevelStateMessage`) and the addition of `humanoidRobotics` in the package path.
   - From `b`, we should add the new import `EuclideanTrajectoryPointMessage` and remove the obsolete import `InvalidPacketNotificationPacket`.
   - The final import list should include all the new and updated imports from both branches, while removing the obsolete one.
