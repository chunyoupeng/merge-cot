### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> private final InstallManager installManager ; <newline> private final RootInstallationRetryHandler rootInstallationRetryHandler ; <newline> private final CrashReport crashReport ; <newline> ; <newline> private InstallCompletedNotifier installCompletedNotifier


## From base to b
<ADD> final final final <newline> private final SharedPreferences sharedPreferences ; <newline> private final SharedPreferences securePreferences ; <newline> private final CrashReport crashReport ; <newline> private final FragmentNavigator fragmentNavigator ; <newline> private final DeepLinkManager deepLinkManager ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the following fields:
     - `private final InstallManager installManager;`
     - `private final RootInstallationRetryHandler rootInstallationRetryHandler;`
     - `private final CrashReport crashReport;`
     - `private InstallCompletedNotifier installCompletedNotifier;`
     - Also added a new line (possibly a typo or formatting issue).
   - **Branch `b`** added the following fields:
     - `private final SharedPreferences sharedPreferences;`
     - `private final SharedPreferences securePreferences;`
     - `private final CrashReport crashReport;`
     - `private final FragmentNavigator fragmentNavigator;`
     - `private final DeepLinkManager deepLinkManager;`
     - Also added an extra `final` keyword (likely a typo).
   - **Conflict occurs** because both branches added a `CrashReport` field, and both added new fields in the same region of the class.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The `CrashReport` field is added as `final`, which is consistent with good Java practices for immutability.
     - The `InstallManager`, `RootInstallationRetryHandler`, and `InstallCompletedNotifier` are likely related to installation logic and retry handling, which are important for the system's functionality.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The `CrashReport` field is also added as `final`, which is consistent with `a`.
     - The `SharedPreferences`, `securePreferences`, `FragmentNavigator`, and `DeepLinkManager` are likely related to UI navigation and data persistence, which are also important.
     - The extra `final` keyword is a typo and should be removed.
   - **Conflict resolution considerations**:
     - Both branches added a `CrashReport` field. Since both are `final`, we should keep one and remove the duplicate.
     - The rest of the fields are unique to each branch and should be merged.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely focused on installation and retry logic, adding fields to support those features.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely focused on UI navigation and data persistence, adding fields to support those features.
   - The intention is to enhance the class with new dependencies for different functional areas.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Keep all the new fields from both branches.
   - Remove the duplicate `CrashReport` field.
   - Fix the typo in branch `b` (extra `final` keyword).
   - Ensure consistent use of `final` for all added fields.
   - Maintain the correct order and formatting of the class fields.
