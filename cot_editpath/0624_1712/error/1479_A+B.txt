### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

ApplicationCriticalityService applicationCriticalityService,
			PermissionService permissionService, ApplicationService applicationService) {

ScanService scanService, ApplicationChannelService applicationChannelService,
			ChannelTypeService channelTypeService, PermissionService permissionService, 
			ApplicationService applicationService, UploadScanController uploadScanController,
			ApplicationCriticalityService applicationCriticalityService) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ApplicationCriticalityService applicationCriticalityService , <newline>


## From base to b
<ADD> ScanService scanService , ApplicationChannelService applicationChannelService , <newline> ChannelTypeService channelTypeService , <newline> , UploadScanController uploadScanController , <newline> ApplicationCriticalityService applicationCriticalityService


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the constructor includes the following services: `PermissionService permissionService, ApplicationService applicationService`.
   - In branch `a`, `ApplicationCriticalityService applicationCriticalityService` is added at the beginning of the parameter list.
   - In branch `b`, multiple services are added in the following order: `ScanService scanService`, `ApplicationChannelService applicationChannelService`, `ChannelTypeService channelTypeService`, `UploadScanController uploadScanController`, and `ApplicationCriticalityService applicationCriticalityService`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** adds `ApplicationCriticalityService` to the constructor. This is a straightforward addition and likely reflects a need for the service in the class logic.
   - **Branch `b`** adds multiple services, which suggests a broader expansion of the class's responsibilities or dependencies. The order of the added services in `b` appears to be logical and grouped thematically (e.g., scanning-related services, channel-related services, etc.).
   - The conflict arises because both branches attempt to add `ApplicationCriticalityService`, but `a` adds it at the beginning while `b` adds it later in the list.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to prioritize `ApplicationCriticalityService` by placing it at the beginning of the parameter list, possibly for organizational or readability reasons.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to expand the class's capabilities by adding multiple services, with `ApplicationCriticalityService` being one of several new dependencies.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `b` adds more services and provides a more comprehensive list, it is better to preserve the order and grouping of services as defined in `b`.
   - However, the `ApplicationCriticalityService` from `a` should also be included, and to avoid duplication, it should be placed in the same position as in `b`.
   - The final resolution should include all services from `b`, with `ApplicationCriticalityService` placed in the same position as in `b` to avoid duplication and maintain consistency.
