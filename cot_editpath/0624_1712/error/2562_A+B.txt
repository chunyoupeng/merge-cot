### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a new method pair: `getSendAttemptLimit()` and `setSendAttemptLimit(...)`. These methods define a limit on the number of notifications a connection may attempt to send before shutting down.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces a different method pair: `getCloseAfterInactivityTime()` and `setCloseAfterInactivityTime(...)`. These methods define a time limit (in seconds) after which a connection will be closed due to inactivity.
   - The conflict arises because both branches are adding new methods to the same class, and Git cannot determine which one to keep or how to merge them.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces a feature that limits the number of send attempts, which is useful for ensuring graceful shutdowns and preventing notification loss due to buffer overflows.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces a feature that closes connections after a period of inactivity, which is useful for managing resources and ensuring connections are not left open indefinitely.
   - Both features are logically distinct and serve different purposes. There is no overlap in functionality or code structure.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve reliability and control over how many notifications are sent before a connection is closed.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to improve resource management by closing idle connections after a period of inactivity.
   - The intentions are complementary and do not conflict with each other.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of methods are logically distinct and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to **keep both sets of methods**.
   - The class should now support both a send-attempt limit and an inactivity timeout.
   - No code style or correctness issues are introduced by combining these two features.
