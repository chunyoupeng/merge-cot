### Prompt

You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the import section of the Java file.
   - In `a`, the imports include `static org.mockito.Mockito.doReturn`, `verify`, and `never`.
   - In `b`, the imports include `static org.mockito.Mockito.*;`, which is a wildcard import for all static methods from `Mockito`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** explicitly imports only the specific static methods it uses (`doReturn`, `verify`, `never`). This is good for clarity and avoids unnecessary imports.
   - **Branch `b`** uses a wildcard import (`Mockito.*`), which is more concise but potentially less readable and can lead to ambiguity if multiple static methods are imported from different classes.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims for clarity and minimalism, importing only what is needed.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims for brevity and convenience, reducing the number of import lines.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The wildcard import in `b` is more concise and avoids redundancy, especially when multiple static methods from the same class are used.
   - However, in a professional setting, explicit imports are often preferred for clarity and to avoid potential naming conflicts.
   - Since both branches are importing from the same class (`Mockito`), and the wildcard import in `b` covers all the static methods used in `a`, it is reasonable to resolve the conflict by using the wildcard import from `b` and removing the explicit imports from `a`.
