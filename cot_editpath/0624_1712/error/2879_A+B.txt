### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
All content from the base has been removed


## From base to b
<ADD> import us . ihmc . robotics . math . trajectories . YoFrameTrajectory3D ; <newline> import us . ihmc . robotics . math . trajectories . YoSegmentedFrameTrajectory3D ; <newline> import us . ihmc . robotics . math . trajectories . YoTrajectory ; <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** has removed all content from the base, including the `import us.ihmc.robotics.referenceFrames.ReferenceFrame;` line.
   - **Branch `b`** has added three new import statements related to trajectory classes (`YoFrameTrajectory3D`, `YoSegmentedFrameTrajectory3D`, and `YoTrajectory`) while keeping the original `ReferenceFrame` import.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** appears to have removed all content, which is likely a mistake or a misoperation. This change is not useful and should be discarded.
   - **Branch `b`** adds relevant imports that are likely needed for trajectory-related functionality. These imports are specific and meaningful, and they do not conflict with the existing `ReferenceFrame` import.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** seems to have removed everything, possibly by accident or as part of a larger refactor that is not relevant here.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely extending the code to support trajectory functionality, which is a logical and necessary addition.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a`'s changes are not useful and likely erroneous, we discard them.
   - We retain the changes from branch `b` because they add necessary imports without conflict.
   - The final result should include the original `ReferenceFrame` import and the three new trajectory-related imports from branch `b`.
