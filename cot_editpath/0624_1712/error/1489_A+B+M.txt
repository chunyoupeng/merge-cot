### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two branches, `a` and `b`, both of which have added completely different sets of fields to the class.
   - Branch `a` introduces a set of private fields related to OAuth, payment, billing, and request handling.
   - Branch `b` introduces a set of private fields related to notifications, including a `NotificationHandler`, a periodicity constant for social notifications, and a `NotificationCenter`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both sets of changes are valid and likely serve different functional areas of the application.
   - Branch `a` is likely related to payment and billing logic, such as intercepting requests, handling authorization, and managing purchases.
   - Branch `b` is likely related to notification handling, such as managing notification types, scheduling, and centers.
   - Neither branch modifies the same fields or overlaps in functionality, so there is no direct conflict in the logic itself.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to enhance the application's ability to handle OAuth, payment, and billing operations.
   - The intention of `b` is to enhance the application's ability to handle notifications, including scheduling and notification centers.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of fields are unrelated and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes.
   - This ensures that the application retains both the payment/billing functionality and the notification functionality.
   - No code style or correctness issues are apparent, and the fields are logically grouped by their purpose.
