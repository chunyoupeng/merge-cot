### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
XmlRevocationOrigin revocationOriginType = XmlRevocationOrigin.valueOf(revocationToken.getOrigin().name());
||||||| base
RevocationOriginType revocationOriginType = RevocationOriginType.valueOf(revocationToken.getOrigin().name());
=======
RevocationOriginType revocationOriginType = RevocationOriginType.valueOf(revocationToken.getOrigin().name());
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> RevocationOriginType <WITH> XmlRevocationOrigin)
<REPLACE> RevocationOriginType <WITH> XmlRevocationOrigin)



# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     RevocationOriginType revocationOriginType = RevocationOriginType.valueOf(revocationToken.getOrigin().name());
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is:
     ```java
     XmlRevocationOrigin revocationOriginType = XmlRevocationOrigin.valueOf(revocationToken.getOrigin().name());
     ```
     This means that `a` has replaced `RevocationOriginType` with `XmlRevocationOrigin` in both the variable declaration and the enum call.
   - In branch `b`, the line is the same as in the base:
     ```java
     RevocationOriginType revocationOriginType = RevocationOriginType.valueOf(revocationToken.getOrigin().name());
     ```
     So, `b` has not made any changes to this line.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** It appears that `a` is trying to switch the enum type from `RevocationOriginType` to `XmlRevocationOrigin`. This could be due to a refactoring or a new feature that requires a different enum type.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** No change was made, so it is likely that `b` is not aware of or does not require the new enum type introduced in `a`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:** The intention is to use a new enum type (`XmlRevocationOrigin`) instead of the old one (`RevocationOriginType`). This could be part of a larger effort to modularize or rename types for clarity or to support XML-specific logic.
   - **Branch `b`:** The intention is to keep the original logic intact, likely because it is not affected by the changes in `a`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - If the change in `a` is valid and represents an intentional refactoring or enhancement, it should be kept.
   - If `XmlRevocationOrigin` is a newer or more appropriate type than `RevocationOriginType`, then the code from `a` should be used.
   - Since `b` has not made any changes, it is likely that the change in `a` is the correct one to keep.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to adopt the code from `a`.
