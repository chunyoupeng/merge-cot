### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
import com.salesforce.phoenix.schema.TableNotFoundException;
||||||| base

=======
import com.salesforce.phoenix.jdbc.PhoenixStatement;
import com.salesforce.phoenix.query.KeyRange;
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` added different import statements to the same file.
   - Branch `a` added: `import com.salesforce.phoenix.schema.TableNotFoundException;`
   - Branch `b` added: `import com.salesforce.phoenix.jdbc.PhoenixStatement;` and `import com.salesforce.phoenix.query.KeyRange;`

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The import `TableNotFoundException` from branch `a` is likely used for handling exceptions related to missing tables.
   - The imports `PhoenixStatement` and `KeyRange` from branch `b` are likely used for working with Phoenix JDBC statements and key ranges in queries.
   - All these imports are valid and serve different purposes. There is no overlap or conflict in the functionality they provide.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` likely added the import to handle table-related exceptions in the code.
   - Branch `b` likely added the imports to support query construction or key-range-based operations.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since all the imports are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to include all of them in the final code.
   - This ensures that both branches' functionalities are preserved without any loss or conflict.
