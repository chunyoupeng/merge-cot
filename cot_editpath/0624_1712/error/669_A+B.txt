### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a

## From base to b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added two new private final fields:
     - `private final YoFramePoint yoSingleSupportFinalCoM;`
     - `private final FramePoint singleSupportFinalCoM = new FramePoint();`
     - These fields are initialized in the constructor.
   - **Branch `b`** added two new private final fields:
     - `private final FullHumanoidRobotModel fullRobotModel;`
     - `private final double gravityZ;`
     - These fields are initialized in the constructor as well.
   - The constructor signature in `a` remains the same as in the base, while `b` added two new parameters: `FullHumanoidRobotModel fullRobotModel` and `double gravityZ`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** introduces fields related to the center of mass (`yoSingleSupportFinalCoM` and `singleSupportFinalCoM`) and likely enhances the planner's ability to handle smooth transitions in the center of mass during single support phases.
   - **Branch `b`** introduces a `FullHumanoidRobotModel` and a `gravityZ` parameter, which likely provides more detailed robot model information and physical constants to the planner, enabling more accurate or realistic planning.
   - Both changes are additive and do not directly conflict in terms of logic or data types. However, the constructor parameters differ, and the fields added by each branch are distinct.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve the planner's handling of center of mass dynamics during single support phases.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to provide the planner with a more comprehensive robot model and physical constants for more accurate planning.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the fields and constructor parameters added by `a` and `b` are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to merge both sets of changes.
   - The constructor will need to be updated to include all the new parameters from both branches.
   - The fields from both branches should be declared and initialized in the constructor accordingly.
   - This approach preserves the functionality and intentions of both branches without conflict.
