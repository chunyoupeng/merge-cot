### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
_outputContext.typeDesc()));
||||||| base
_writeContext.typeDesc()));
=======
_cborContext.typeDesc()));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> _writeContext <WITH> _outputContext)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> _writeContext <WITH> _cborContext)


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is: `_writeContext.typeDesc()));`
   - In branch `a`, it is changed to: `_outputContext.typeDesc()));`
   - In branch `b`, it is changed to: `_cborContext.typeDesc()));`
   - The conflict arises because both branches `a` and `b` independently replaced the same variable `_writeContext` with different alternatives: `_outputContext` and `_cborContext`, respectively.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** replaces `_writeContext` with `_outputContext`. This suggests a shift in the context from writing to outputting, possibly indicating a change in the stage or purpose of the operation.
   - **Branch `b`** replaces `_writeContext` with `_cborContext`. This implies a switch to using a CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) context, likely for serialization or data formatting purposes.
   - Both changes are semantically distinct and serve different purposes. `_outputContext` may be for general output, while `_cborContext` is for a specific binary format.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` appears to be general-purpose output handling.
   - The intention in `b` is likely to support CBOR-specific operations, such as encoding or decoding data in CBOR format.
   - These intentions are not mutually exclusive, but they are distinct enough that merging them directly would require clarification or additional context.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both branches have made distinct and meaningful changes, the best resolution is to **choose one based on the intended use of the code**.
   - If the code is intended for general output, `_outputContext` should be used.
   - If the code is intended for CBOR-specific operations, `_cborContext` should be used.
   - Without further context, we assume the CBOR-specific change is more specific and likely more aligned with the current purpose of the code, so we choose `_cborContext`.
