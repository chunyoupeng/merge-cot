### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

final LoanProductGuaranteeDetails loanProductGuaranteeDetails, final BigDecimal principalThresholdForLastInstalment) {
||||||| base
final LoanProductGuaranteeDetails loanProductGuaranteeDetails) {
=======
final LoanProductGuaranteeDetails loanProductGuaranteeDetails, final boolean accountMovesOutOfNPAOnlyOnArrearsCompletion) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , final BigDecimal principalThresholdForLastInstalment


## From base to b
<ADD> , final boolean accountMovesOutOfNPAOnlyOnArrearsCompletion


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The base method signature is:  
     `final LoanProductGuaranteeDetails loanProductGuaranteeDetails)`
   - Branch `a` added a new parameter:  
     `final BigDecimal principalThresholdForLastInstalment`
   - Branch `b` added a different new parameter:  
     `final boolean accountMovesOutOfNPAOnlyOnArrearsCompletion`
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new parameter to the same method, and Git cannot automatically merge these two additions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:**  
     The parameter `principalThresholdForLastInstalment` of type `BigDecimal` likely represents a financial threshold used in calculating the last installment of a loan. This is a meaningful addition for loan calculation logic.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:**  
     The parameter `accountMovesOutOfNPAOnlyOnArrearsCompletion` of type `boolean` likely controls whether an account can move out of a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) status only after all arrears are cleared. This is a meaningful addition for loan status management logic.
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. Neither should be discarded outright.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:**  
     To support more granular financial calculations, particularly for the last installment of a loan.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:**  
     To enforce stricter rules for when a loan account can be marked as no longer in NPA status.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both parameters are logically distinct and serve different purposes, the correct resolution is to **combine both changes** into the final method signature.
   - The order of the parameters should be preserved as per the original order in each branch, with `loanProductGuaranteeDetails` first, followed by the new parameters from `a` and `b` in the order they were added.
