### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> MarkupDocBuilderUtils <WITH> markupDocBuilder)
<REPLACE> tableWithHeaderRow <WITH> tableWithColumnSpecs)
<REPLACE> Arrays <WITH> cols)
<DELETE> . asList ( 1 , 6 , 1 ) , this . markupDocBuilder


## From base to b
<ADD> , docBuilder
<REPLACE> this <WITH> docBuilder)
<DELETE> . markupDocBuilder


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line is:
     ```java
     MarkupDocBuilderUtils.tableWithHeaderRow(Arrays.asList(1, 6, 1), cells, this.markupDocBuilder);
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is:
     ```java
     markupDocBuilder.tableWithColumnSpecs(cols, cells);
     ```
     - `MarkupDocBuilderUtils` is replaced with `markupDocBuilder`, suggesting a shift from a static utility method to an instance method.
     - `tableWithHeaderRow` is replaced with `tableWithColumnSpecs`, indicating a method name change.
     - `Arrays.asList(1, 6, 1)` is replaced with `cols`, suggesting a variable is now used instead of a hardcoded list.
     - `this.markupDocBuilder` is removed.
   - In branch `b`, the line is:
     ```java
     MarkupDocBuilderUtils.tableWithHeaderRow(Arrays.asList(1, 6, 1), cells, docBuilder);
     ```
     - `this.markupDocBuilder` is replaced with `docBuilder`, indicating a parameter is now used instead of an instance variable.
     - The rest of the method call remains the same.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - The change from `MarkupDocBuilderUtils` to `markupDocBuilder` suggests a move from a static utility method to an instance method, which is a significant architectural change.
     - The method name change from `tableWithHeaderRow` to `tableWithColumnSpecs` indicates a new API or refactoring.
     - Using `cols` instead of a hardcoded list is more flexible and reusable.
     - Removing `this.markupDocBuilder` implies that the method is now being called on `markupDocBuilder` directly.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Replacing `this.markupDocBuilder` with `docBuilder` suggests a parameter is now being passed instead of using an instance variable.
     - This is a more minor change compared to `a` and likely aims to make the method more modular or testable.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to refactor the code to use a more modern or flexible API (`tableWithColumnSpecs`) and to use a variable (`cols`) instead of a hardcoded list.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to make the method more modular by passing `docBuilder` as a parameter instead of using an instance variable.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `a` appears to be more substantial and likely represents a more modern or flexible API usage.
   - The change in `b` is a smaller refactor that aligns with making the method more modular.
   - Since `a` is using `markupDocBuilder` directly and calling a new method (`tableWithColumnSpecs`), it is likely the more up-to-date or preferred approach.
   - Therefore, the resolution should adopt the changes from `a`, as it represents a more significant and likely more correct refactor.
