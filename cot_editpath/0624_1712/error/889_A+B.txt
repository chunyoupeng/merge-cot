### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> <newline> import org . n52 . iceland . ogc . sos . CapabilitiesExtension ; <newline> import org . n52 . iceland . ogc . sos . CapabilitiesExtensionKey ; <newline> import org . n52 . iceland . ogc . sos . CapabilitiesExtensionProvider ;


## From base to b
<REPLACE> ogc <WITH> exception)
<DELETE> . om . OmObservableProperty ; <newline> import org . n52 . iceland . ogc


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the following imports from the base:
     - `import org.n52.iceland.ogc.sos.CapabilitiesExtension;`
     - `import org.n52.iceland.ogc.sos.CapabilitiesExtensionKey;`
     - `import org.n52.iceland.ogc.sos.CapabilitiesExtensionProvider;`
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replaced `ogc` with `exception` in the package name for `OwsExceptionReport`, changing it from `org.n52.iceland.ogc.ows.OwsExceptionReport` to `org.n52.iceland.exception.ows.OwsExceptionReport`.
     - Removed the import for `OmObservableProperty` and the `import org.n52.iceland.ogc` prefix.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - The removal of the `CapabilitiesExtension`-related imports suggests that the code in branch `a` no longer uses these classes. This could be due to refactoring or removing unused code.
     - If these classes are no longer used, removing the imports is a valid cleanup.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The replacement of `ogc.ows` with `exception.ows` for `OwsExceptionReport` indicates a reorganization of the package structure. This is likely a refactor to better categorize the exception classes.
     - The removal of `OmObservableProperty` suggests that this class is no longer used in branch `b`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to clean up unused imports related to `CapabilitiesExtension`, possibly because the code no longer uses SOS capabilities or the logic has been moved elsewhere.
   - **Branch `b`** is likely reorganizing the package structure to separate exception-related classes into their own package (`exception`) for better modularity and clarity.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `OwsExceptionReport` import should be updated to use the new package path from branch `b` (`org.n52.iceland.exception.ows.OwsExceptionReport`), as it reflects a structural refactor.
   - The `OmObservableProperty` import should be removed, as both branches have removed it.
   - The `CapabilitiesExtension`-related imports should be removed as well, as branch `a` removed them and branch `b` does not reintroduce them.

# Final Resolution

import org.n52.iceland.ogc.sos.CapabilitiesExtension;
import org.n52.iceland.ogc.sos.CapabilitiesExtensionKey;
