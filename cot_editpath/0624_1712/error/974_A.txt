### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public boolean isMapped() {
		return isMapped;
	}
||||||| base

=======
// For debugging
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return String.format("HDT[file=%s,#triples=%d]", hdtFileName, triples.getNumberOfElements());
	}
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two completely different methods:
     - `a` added a method `isMapped()` that returns a boolean value.
     - `b` added a method `toString()` that overrides the default `toString()` method and returns a formatted string for debugging.
   - The base is empty, so both `a` and `b` are adding new content independently.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - `isMapped()` is a simple getter method, likely used to expose the state of a boolean field `isMapped`.
   - `toString()` is a standard method for debugging and logging, providing a human-readable representation of the object.
   - Both changes are valid and serve different purposes. There is no overlap or conflict in functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to provide access to the `isMapped` state.
   - The intention of `b` is to improve debugging by overriding `toString()`.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both changes are independent and do not interfere with each other, the best resolution is to merge both methods into the final code.
   - No modifications are needed to either method.

```java
public boolean isMapped() {
    return isMapped;
}

// For debugging
@Override
public String toString() {
    return String.format("HDT[file=%s,#triples=%d]", hdtFileName, triples.getNumberOfElements());
}
```
