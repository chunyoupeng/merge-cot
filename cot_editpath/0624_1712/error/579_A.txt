### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the original logic with a call to `ResultServiceHelper.invokeResultServices();`.
     - Removed the code that loads `ResultService` beans, iterates over them, and calls `refreshStates()` and `saveAllResults()`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Introduced a `SortedSet` of `ResultService` objects using a `PrioritizedServiceComparator`.
     - Replaced the iteration over `resultServices.values()` with iteration over the sorted set `services`.
     - Removed the `.values()` call from `resultServices.values()`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change is a **simplification** of the logic by offloading the responsibility to a helper method.
     - This could be beneficial if `invokeResultServices()` encapsulates the same or more complex logic in a reusable way.
     - However, it **removes the explicit control** over the order of execution and the possibility of custom sorting.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The change introduces **ordering** of `ResultService` instances using a comparator.
     - This is useful if the order in which services are processed matters (e.g., for dependencies or prioritization).
     - It retains the original logic but enhances it with a more sophisticated behavior.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to **simplify and encapsulate** the logic for saving results into a helper method.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to **improve the behavior** by ensuring services are processed in a specific order.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The **intention of `b`** (ordering services) is **more specific and behavior-enhancing**, and it aligns with a more robust design if ordering is important.
   - The **intention of `a`** (simplification) is also valid, but it **discards the ordering logic** introduced in `b`.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to **combine both intentions**: use the sorted set from `b` and encapsulate the logic in a helper method as in `a`.

   The final code should:
   - Use the sorted set from `b`.
   - Call a helper method (e.g., `invokeResultServices`) that encapsulates the iteration and method calls.
</cot>

```java
//save results for all active result services
Map<String, ResultService> resultServices = BeanLoader.loadMultipleBeans(ResultService.class);
SortedSet<ResultService> services = new TreeSet<>(new PrioritizedServiceComparator<ResultService>());
services.addAll(resultServices.values());
ResultServiceHelper.invokeResultServices(services);
```
