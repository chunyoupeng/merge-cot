### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public Map<PresentCondition, Long> getCaseCountPerPersonCondition(CaseCriteria caseCriteria) {
		User user = userService.getCurrentUser();
||||||| base
public Map<PresentCondition, Long> getCaseCountPerPersonCondition(CaseCriteria caseCriteria, String userUuid) {
		User user = userService.getByUuid(userUuid);
=======
@Override
	public Map<PresentCondition, Long> getCaseCountPerPersonCondition(CaseCriteria caseCriteria, String userUuid, boolean includeSharedCases) {
		User user = userService.getByUuid(userUuid);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> , String userUuid
<REPLACE> getByUuid <WITH> getCurrentUser)
<DELETE> userUuid


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Override <newline> , boolean includeSharedCases


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Removed the `userUuid` parameter from the method signature.
     - Replaced `userService.getByUuid(userUuid)` with `userService.getCurrentUser()`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added an `@Override` annotation.
     - Added a new `includeSharedCases` boolean parameter to the method signature.
     - Kept the original `userUuid` parameter and the `userService.getByUuid(userUuid)` logic.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes**:
     - Removing `userUuid` and using `getCurrentUser()` implies that the method should always use the currently logged-in user, which is a common pattern in user-specific logic.
     - This change simplifies the method by removing a parameter that is now redundant.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes**:
     - Adding `@Override` is a good practice if the method is overriding a parent method.
     - Adding `includeSharedCases` introduces a new feature to control whether shared cases should be included in the result, which is a logical and useful extension.
     - Keeping `userUuid` and `getByUuid` suggests that the method should still support retrieving data for any user, not just the current one.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aims to simplify the method and make it more user-centric by always using the current user.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aims to extend the method's functionality to include shared cases and ensure it is an override of a parent method.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method should retain the `@Override` annotation from `b` to maintain good coding practices.
   - The `includeSharedCases` parameter from `b` should be included to support the new functionality.
   - The `userUuid` parameter from `b` should be retained to allow the method to work for any user, not just the current one.
   - The `getCurrentUser()` logic from `a` is not appropriate here because the method should still support retrieving data for any user, not just the current one.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the `userUuid` parameter and the `getByUuid` logic from `b`, add the `includeSharedCases` parameter from `b`, and include the `@Override` annotation.

@Override

	User user = userService.getByUuid(userUuid);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
