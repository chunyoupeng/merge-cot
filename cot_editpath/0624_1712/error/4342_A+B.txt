### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
*         when the document identifier does not refer to an existing document
     * @throws org.bonitasoft.engine.session.InvalidSessionException
     *         when the session is not valid

     *         Generic exception thrown if API Session is invalid, e.g session has expired.
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> org . bonitasoft . engine . session .


## From base to b
<REPLACE> when <WITH> If)
<REPLACE> document <WITH> specified)

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added the full package name `org.bonitasoft.engine.session.` to the `InvalidSessionException` in the Javadoc. This change makes the exception fully qualified, which is useful in cases where there might be ambiguity or multiple classes with the same name.
   - **Branch `b`** made several changes to the Javadoc:
     - Replaced "when" with "If" and "Generic".
     - Replaced "document" with "specified".
     - Added a more detailed explanation of the exception: "Generic exception thrown if API Session is invalid, e.g session has expired."
     - Changed the wording to be more descriptive and precise.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is about improving clarity and avoiding ambiguity by using the fully qualified class name. This is a common practice in Java documentation, especially in large codebases with multiple packages.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes** are about improving the clarity and specificity of the Javadoc. The message is more descriptive and provides context about when the exception is thrown (e.g., session has expired). This is also a good practice for API documentation.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intended to make the exception unambiguous by using the full package name.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intended to improve the clarity and usefulness of the Javadoc for developers using the API.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and serve different but complementary purposes.
   - The fully qualified name from `a` should be retained to avoid ambiguity.
   - The improved wording and additional explanation from `b` should also be retained to improve clarity.
   - The resolution should combine both changes in a way that is grammatically correct and maintains the original intent of both branches.

     * @throws org.bonitasoft.engine.session.InvalidSessionException
     *         Generic exception thrown if API Session is invalid, e.g. session has expired.
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
*         If the specified identifier does not refer to an existing document.
     * @throws org.bonitasoft.engine.session.InvalidSessionException
     *         Generic exception thrown if API Session is invalid, e.g session has expired.
