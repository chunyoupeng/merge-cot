### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
return "function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ") " + IBLOCK((PassNode) n.getChild(1));

        return "function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ")" + n.getChild(1).getText();
||||||| base
return FUNCTION + n.getChild(0).getText() + ") " + IBLOCK((PassNode) n.getChild(1));


        return FUNCTION + n.getChild(0).getText() + ")" + n.getChild(1).getText();
=======
return FUNCTION + n.getChild(0).getText() + ") { " + n.getChild(1).getText() +" }";

        return FUNCTION + n.getChild(0).getText() + ")" + n.getChild(1).getText();
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> FUNCTION <WITH> ")
<ADD> function ( "
<DELETE> <newline>
<REPLACE> FUNCTION <WITH> ")
<ADD> function ( "


## From base to b
<ADD> {
<DELETE> IBLOCK ( ( PassNode )
<ADD> . getText ( + " } "
<DELETE> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Replaced `FUNCTION` with `"function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ")"`.
     - Removed the newline character.
     - Removed the `IBLOCK((PassNode) n.getChild(1))` and replaced it with `n.getChild(1).getText()`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Added `{` and `}` around `n.getChild(1).getText()`.
     - Removed `IBLOCK((PassNode) n.getChild(1))`.
     - Also removed the newline character.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The replacement of `FUNCTION` with `"function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ")"` is likely to make the function declaration more explicit and readable.
     - Removing the newline character is likely to make the code more compact.
     - Replacing `IBLOCK((PassNode) n.getChild(1))` with `n.getChild(1).getText()` suggests that the intention is to directly use the text of the child node without wrapping it in an `IBLOCK`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Adding `{` and `}` around `n.getChild(1).getText()` suggests that the intention is to format the function body as a block.
     - Removing `IBLOCK((PassNode) n.getChild(1))` is similar to branch a's change.
     - Removing the newline character is also similar to branch a's change.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a**:
     - The intention seems to be to make the function declaration more explicit and readable by using a string concatenation to build the function declaration.
     - The removal of `IBLOCK` suggests that the function body should be directly included as text.
   - **Branch b**:
     - The intention seems to be to format the function body as a block by adding `{` and `}`.
     - The removal of `IBLOCK` is similar to branch a's change.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both branches aim to simplify the function declaration by removing the `IBLOCK` and making the function body more explicit.
   - Branch a focuses on making the function declaration more explicit by using string concatenation.
   - Branch b focuses on formatting the function body as a block.
   - The best resolution would be to combine the intentions of both branches: make the function declaration more explicit and format the function body as a block.
   - Therefore, the final resolution should include both the string concatenation for the function declaration and the block formatting for the function body.

# Final Resolution

```java
return "function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ") { " + n.getChild(1).getText() + " }";

        return "function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ") { " + n.getChild(1).getText() + " }";
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
return "function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ") { " + n.getChild(1).getText() +" }";
        return "function (" + n.getChild(0).getText() + ")" + n.getChild(1).getText();
