### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> InvokeOnJavaFXApplicationThread . invoke ( ( ) - >
<DELETE> ; <newline> mesh . isEnabledProperty ( ) . set ( false


## From base to b
<REPLACE> final <WITH> removeMeshes)
<REPLACE> MeshGenerator <WITH> ()
<REPLACE> < <WITH> Collections)
<DELETE> TLongHashSet > mesh = neurons
<REPLACE> remove <WITH> singletonList)
<DELETE> ; <newline> if ( mesh ! = null ) <newline> { <newline> root . getChildren ( ) . remove ( mesh . getRoot ( ) <newline> mesh . isEnabledProperty ( ) . set ( false ) ; <newline> mesh . interrupt ( ) ; <newline> mesh . unbind ( ) ; <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the direct call to `root.getChildren().remove(mesh.getRoot())` with a call to `InvokeOnJavaFXApplicationThread.invoke(() -> ...)` to ensure the removal happens on the JavaFX application thread.
     - Removed the line `mesh.isEnabledProperty().set(false);`.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Completely replaced the code block with a call to `removeMeshes(Collections.singletonList(id));`.
     - This suggests that `removeMeshes` is a helper method that encapsulates the logic for removing a mesh and its associated operations.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The use of `InvokeOnJavaFXApplicationThread.invoke(...)` is a good practice when working with JavaFX UI elements, as UI updates must occur on the JavaFX application thread.
     - Removing `mesh.isEnabledProperty().set(false);` might be intentional if the branch no longer needs to disable the mesh before removal.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Replacing the inline logic with a method call (`removeMeshes(...)`) is a clean and modular approach. It reduces code duplication and improves readability.
     - This change implies that the logic for removing a mesh is now abstracted into a helper method, which is a good design choice.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to ensure thread safety when removing the mesh from the UI by using `InvokeOnJavaFXApplicationThread`.
     - The removal of `mesh.isEnabledProperty().set(false);` suggests that the mesh no longer needs to be disabled before removal, or that this step is no longer necessary.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to refactor the inline logic into a reusable method (`removeMeshes`), which is a good design practice for maintainability and code reuse.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best approach is to combine the intentions of both branches:
     - Use the `removeMeshes` method from branch `b` for modularity and code reuse.
     - Ensure that the call to `removeMeshes` is wrapped in `InvokeOnJavaFXApplicationThread.invoke(...)` from branch `a` to maintain thread safety when interacting with the JavaFX UI.
   - This way, we preserve the benefits of both changes: thread safety and code modularity.

# Final Resolution

```java
InvokeOnJavaFXApplicationThread.invoke(() -> removeMeshes(Collections.singletonList(id)));
```
