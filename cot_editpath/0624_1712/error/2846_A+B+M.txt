### Prompt

You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a` changes:**
     - Introduced a `Dimension` object `fullSize` and an `Info` object `info` based on `fullSize`.
     - Created a `RequestContext`, set the operation list with `fullSize`, and used a `DelegateProxy` to apply `opList` to `info`.
     - Removed the old parameters in `applyNonEndpointMutations` and replaced them with `info` and `proxy`.
   - **Branch `b` changes:**
     - Removed the comment `// Downscale`.
     - Modified the `OperationList` to include an `Encode(Format.JPG)` operation.
     - Changed the `Info` constructor to use `new Info()` (no arguments).
     - Retained the old parameter list for `applyNonEndpointMutations` (host, URI, etc.).

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`:**
     - Introduces a more modular and encapsulated approach by using `RequestContext` and `DelegateProxy`.
     - This suggests a shift toward a more structured and possibly more scalable architecture.
     - The use of `fullSize` and `info` implies a desire to separate the source image metadata from the operation logic.
   - **Branch `b`:**
     - Introduces a new operation (`Encode`) to the `OperationList`, which is a logical extension of the operation pipeline.
     - The use of `new Info()` suggests a change in the `Info` class to allow default or no-argument construction.
     - Retains the legacy parameter list for `applyNonEndpointMutations`, which may be outdated or redundant if the `Info` object already contains the necessary metadata.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:**
     - To refactor the code for better modularity and encapsulation.
     - To use a proxy-based architecture for applying operations, which may be more flexible or testable.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:**
     - To extend the operation pipeline with an encoding step.
     - To simplify the `Info` object creation, possibly to allow for dynamic or default values.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `Encode(Format.JPG)` operation from `b` is a logical and necessary addition to the operation list.
   - The `RequestContext` and `DelegateProxy` from `a` provide a cleaner and more modular way to apply the operations.
   - The `Info` object from `a` (`new Info(fullSize)`) is more descriptive and likely more robust than the no-argument version from `b`.
   - The legacy parameters in `applyNonEndpointMutations` from `b

### Gold (Ground Truth)
final Dimension fullSize = new Dimension(2000, 1000);
        final Info info = Info.builder().withSize(fullSize).build();
        final OperationList opList = new OperationList(
                new Identifier("cats"),
                new Scale(0.5f),
                new Encode(Format.JPG));
        final RequestContext context = new RequestContext();
        context.setOperationList(opList, fullSize);
        DelegateProxyService service = DelegateProxyService.getInstance();
        DelegateProxy proxy = service.newDelegateProxy(context);

        opList.applyNonEndpointMutations(info, proxy);
