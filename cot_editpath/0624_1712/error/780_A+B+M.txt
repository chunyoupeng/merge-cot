### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> jj_3R_612 <WITH> jj_3R_613)


## From base to b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** renamed the method `jj_3R_612()` to `jj_3R_613()`.
   - **Branch `b`** added a completely new method `jj_3R_300()` with its own logic.
   - The conflict is not in the same method body but in the naming of a method in `a` and the addition of a new method in `b`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change:** Renaming a method is a minor change and likely reflects a refactoring or naming convention update. It does not affect the logic of the method itself.
   - **Branch `b`'s change:** Adding a new method `jj_3R_300()` introduces new functionality. It is a significant addition and should be preserved unless it conflicts with other logic.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s intention:** To rename the method for clarity or consistency with other naming conventions.
   - **Branch `b`'s intention:** To introduce a new parser rule for handling a specific grammar construct (likely related to a `REVOKE` statement).

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the changes are in different methods and do not conflict directly, both changes can be merged.
   - The method `jj_3R_612()` is renamed to `jj_3R_613()` in `a`, so the new name should be used.
   - The new method `jj_3R_300()` from `b` should be added as is.
   - No logic overlaps or conflicts exist between the two changes.
