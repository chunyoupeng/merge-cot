### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<DELETE> <newline> <newline> public static final IndexMetaData PROTO = IndexMetaData . builder ( " " ) <newline> . settings ( Settings . builder ( ) . put ( IndexMetaData . SETTING_VERSION_CREATED , Version . CURRENT ) ) <newline> . numberOfShards ( 1 ) . numberOfReplicas ( 0 ) . build ( ) ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed two newline characters before the `public static final IndexMetaData PROTO` declaration and removed a space before the opening parenthesis in the `Settings.builder()` call.
   - **Branch `b`** completely deleted the entire block of code that defines the `PROTO` constant, including the `public static final IndexMetaData PROTO` line and all subsequent lines.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** made minor formatting changes (removing extra newlines and a space). These are stylistic and do not affect functionality.
   - **Branch `b`** removed the entire `PROTO` constant, which is a significant functional change. This could indicate an intention to remove or replace the `PROTO` constant entirely.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to clean up the code formatting for readability and consistency.
   - **Branch `b`** likely aimed to remove the `PROTO` constant, possibly because it is no longer needed or will be replaced with a different implementation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `b` removes the entire `PROTO` constant, it suggests a more substantial change in the code's functionality. If the intention is to remove `PROTO`, then the resolution should reflect that.
   - However, if `PROTO` is still needed, we should preserve it with the formatting improvements from branch `a`.
   - Given the information, it is safer to assume that the removal in branch `b` is intentional and should be preserved, unless there is a clear reason to keep `PROTO`.

   Therefore, the resolution should reflect the removal of the `PROTO` constant as done in branch `b`.

```java
public class IndexMetaData implements Diffable<IndexMetaData>, FromXContentBuilder<IndexMetaData>, ToXContent {

    // (PROTO constant removed as per branch b)
}
```
