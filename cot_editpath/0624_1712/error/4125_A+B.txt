### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
meta.put("trusted_node", TrustedNodeUtil.getInstance().toJSON());
            meta.put("receives", ReceiveLookAtUtil.getInstance().toJSON());
||||||| base

=======
meta.put("tx_aux", TxAuxUtil.getInstance().toJSON());
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs because both branches `a` and `b` added a line to the `meta` object, but with different keys and values.
   - In branch `a`, the line is:
     ```java
     meta.put("trusted_node", TrustedNodeUtil.getInstance().toJSON());
     ```
   - In branch `b`, the line is:
     ```java
     meta.put("tx_aux", TxAuxUtil.getInstance().toJSON());
     ```
   - The base is empty, so both branches independently added their own lines.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both lines are adding metadata to the `meta` object, which suggests they are both contributing to the same general purpose: enriching the metadata.
   - The keys `"trusted_node"` and `"tx_aux"` appear to represent different types of metadata. One might be related to trust or node information, while the other might be related to transaction auxiliary data.
   - Since both keys are distinct and the values are generated by different utility classes, there is no direct overlap or conflict in the data being added.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in both branches is to add a new metadata field to the `meta` object.
   - The intention is likely to enhance the metadata structure with additional information relevant to the system's functionality.
   - There is no indication that one key should override the other or that the two keys are mutually exclusive.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both keys are distinct and the values are from different utility classes, both lines should be retained.
   - The resolution should include both lines in the final code.
   - The order of the lines may not be significant, but it is best to preserve the order from the branches if it reflects a logical sequence.
