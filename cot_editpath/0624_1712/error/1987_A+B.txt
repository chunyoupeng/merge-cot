### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict

=======
@Test
    public void emptyDependencyList() {
        SchemaLoader.load(get("emptyDependencyList"));
    }

    @Test @Ignore
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<DELETE> @ Ignore


## From base to b
<ADD> @ Test <newline> public void emptyDependencyList ( ) { <newline> SchemaLoader . load ( get ( " emptyDependencyList " ) ) ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base, there is a line: `@Test @Ignore`
   - In branch `a`, the `@Ignore` annotation is removed, resulting in: `@Test`
   - In branch `b`, a new method `emptyDependencyList()` is added with the content:
     ```java
     @Test
         public void emptyDependencyList() {
             SchemaLoader.load(get("emptyDependencyList"));
         }
     ```
     and the original `@Test @Ignore` is retained.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** removes the `@Ignore` annotation from the test. This suggests the intention is to enable the test for execution.
   - **Branch `b`** adds a new test method `emptyDependencyList()`, which introduces a new test case. It also retains the original `@Test @Ignore` line, which may be redundant or leftover from the base.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely wants to activate the existing test (presumably named `emptyDependencyList`) for execution.
   - **Branch `b`** likely wants to add a new test method `emptyDependencyList()` and may have mistakenly left the original `@Test @Ignore` line in place.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The original `@Test @Ignore` line is likely a leftover from the base and should be removed.
   - The new method added by branch `b` should be retained.
   - The removal of `@Ignore` by branch `a` should also be retained to enable the test.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the new method and remove the redundant `@Test @Ignore` line.
