### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
if (recaptchaChallenge != null &&  StringUtils.isNotBlank(recaptchaText)) {
					params.append("&");
					params.append("recaptcha_challenge_field=");
||||||| base
if (recaptchaChallenge != null && recaptchaText != null && recaptchaText.length() > 0) {
					params.append("&");
					params.append("recaptcha_challenge_field=");
=======
if (recaptchaChallenge != null && recaptchaText != null && recaptchaText.length() > 0) {
					params.append("&recaptcha_challenge_field=");
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> StringUtils . isNotBlank (
<DELETE> ! = null & & recaptchaText . length ( > 0


## From base to b
<DELETE> " ) ; <newline> params . append ( "


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the condition `recaptchaText != null && recaptchaText.length() > 0` with `StringUtils.isNotBlank(recaptchaText)`.
     - This is a common utility method used to check if a string is not null and not empty.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Removed the semicolon `);` at the end of the line and appended `"recaptcha_challenge_field="` directly without a newline.
     - This change seems to be a formatting or code layout adjustment, possibly to make the code more compact or readable.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - The use of `StringUtils.isNotBlank(recaptchaText)` is a more concise and readable way to express the same logic as the original condition.
     - It is a best practice in Java to use utility methods like `StringUtils.isNotBlank` for such checks, as it improves code clarity and reduces the chance of bugs.
     - This change is **beneficial** and should be **kept**.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The removal of the semicolon and newline is a minor formatting change.
     - It doesn't affect the logic of the code but may affect readability depending on the team's style preferences.
     - This change is **neutral** and can be **kept or discarded**, depending on the team's style guide.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aimed to improve code readability and maintainability by using a well-known utility method.
   - **Branch `b`** aimed to reformat the code for compactness or alignment with a different style preference.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The logic from **branch `a`** is more robust and readable and should be retained.
   - The formatting change from **branch `b`** is minor and can be adapted to match the logic from `a`.
   - The final code should combine the improved logic from `a` with a clean formatting style.
