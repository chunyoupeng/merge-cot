### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict

    @Override
    public boolean hasRequestableProcedureDescriptionFormat(String format) {
        return getRequestableProcedureDescriptionFormat().contains(format);
    }
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** removed the comment line `//#################` from the base.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new method `hasRequestableProcedureDescriptionFormat(String format)` that checks if a given format is contained in the result of `getRequestableProcedureDescriptionFormat()`.

   The conflict occurs at the closing brace of a class or method. `a` simply removed a comment line and kept the closing brace as-is. `b` added a new method and also ended with a closing brace. The conflict is about which version of the closing brace and surrounding code to keep.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is minimal and only removes a comment line. This is likely a cleanup or formatting change.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is more substantial and introduces a new method that adds functionality. This is a logical and meaningful addition to the class.

   The comment line `//#################` in `base` appears to be a separator or placeholder, and its removal in `a` is likely not critical to the logic of the code.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely aimed to clean up or remove unnecessary comments.
   - **Branch `b`** aimed to enhance the class by adding a method that improves the usability of the `getRequestableProcedureDescriptionFormat()` method.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The new method in `b` is a valuable addition and should be retained.
   - The removal of the comment in `a` is not essential to the logic and can be safely discarded in favor of keeping the new method.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include the new method from `b` and retain the closing brace as it is in `b`, while ignoring the comment removal from `a`.
