### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
setSaved(newModel, true);
			return true;
||||||| base
setSaved(newModel, true);
=======
// FIXME: removed to be able to set state in MFileManager
//			setSaved(newModel, true);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> return true ;


## From base to b
<ADD> / / FIXME : removed to be able to set state in MFileManager <newline> / /


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the line `setSaved(newModel, true);` is present.
   - In branch `a`, the line `setSaved(newModel, true);` is kept, and a new line `return true;` is added after it.
   - In branch `b`, the line `setSaved(newModel, true);` is commented out with a `FIXME` comment explaining that it was removed to allow setting state in `MFileManager`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** adds a `return true;` after calling `setSaved(newModel, true);`. This suggests that the intention is to indicate success after the operation.
   - **Branch `b`** removes the call to `setSaved(newModel, true);` with a `FIXME` comment. This implies that the removal is intentional and temporary, likely to allow more flexible state management in `MFileManager`.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to ensure that the function returns a success status after calling `setSaved`.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to disable the `setSaved` call temporarily to allow `MFileManager` to manage the state independently.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The `FIXME` in branch `b` indicates that the removal is a workaround or temporary fix. It is likely that the `setSaved` call should be preserved for correctness unless the `FIXME` is resolved.
   - The `return true;` in branch `a` is a logical addition to indicate success.
   - Therefore, the best resolution is to keep the `setSaved(newModel, true);` call and include the `return true;` from branch `a`, while preserving the `FIXME` comment from branch `b` as a note for future reference.

```java
// FIXME: removed to be able to set state in MFileManager
setSaved(newModel, true);
return true;
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
// FIXME: removed to be able to set state in MFileManager
//			setSaved(newModel, true);
			return true;
