### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
* @param interval the timeout interval in milliseconds before sending
   *  a server alive message, if no message is received from the server.
||||||| base
* @param interval the specified interval, in milliseconds.
=======
*
   * @param interval the specified interval, in milliseconds.
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> specified <WITH> timeout)
<DELETE> ,
<ADD> before sending <newline> * a server alive message , if no message is received from the server


## From base to b
<ADD> * <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base version, the Javadoc comment for the `interval` parameter is:
     ```
     * @param interval the specified interval, in milliseconds.
     ```
   - In branch `a`, the line is modified to:
     ```
     * @param interval the timeout interval in milliseconds before sending
        *  a server alive message, if no message is received from the server.
     ```
     This adds more context about the purpose of the interval â€” it's a timeout before sending a server alive message.
   - In branch `b`, the line is modified to:
     ```
     *
        * @param interval the specified interval, in milliseconds.
     ```
     This adds a new line with a single asterisk, which appears to be a formatting change or an incomplete Javadoc addition.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** adds meaningful context to the parameter description, explaining what the interval is used for. This is a **semantic enhancement** that improves clarity for developers.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** appears to be a **formatting-only change** or possibly an incomplete addition. It doesn't add any new information and may be a mistake or a placeholder.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention of `a` is to **clarify the purpose** of the `interval` parameter, which is important for understanding the behavior of the system.
   - The intention of `b` is less clear. It could be an attempt to reformat the Javadoc or to start a new comment block, but it doesn't contribute any meaningful content.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since `a`'s change adds **valuable semantic information**, it should be **kept**.
   - `b`'s change is **not useful** and may be a formatting artifact or incomplete. It should be **discarded**.
   - The final merged Javadoc should retain the enhanced description from `a` and avoid the unnecessary formatting from `b`.
