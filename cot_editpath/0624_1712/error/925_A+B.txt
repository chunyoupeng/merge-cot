### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
@Override
    public WebSocket start() {
||||||| base
public void start() {
=======
public WebSocketClient setupSsl(InputStream keyStore, String pass) {
        sslFactory = new SslFactory(keyStore, pass);
        return this;
    }

    public void start() {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> @ Override <newline>
<REPLACE> void <WITH> WebSocket)


## From base to b
<ADD> public WebSocketClient setupSsl ( InputStream keyStore , String pass ) { <newline> sslFactory = new SslFactory ( keyStore , pass ) ; <newline> return this ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a**:
     - Added the `@Override` annotation to the `start()` method.
     - Changed the return type of `start()` from `void` to `WebSocket`.
   - **Branch b**:
     - Added a new method `setupSsl(InputStream keyStore, String pass)` that sets up SSL configuration and returns `this`.
     - No changes were made to the `start()` method in this branch.

   The conflict occurs in the `start()` method. Branch `a` changes the return type and adds an override annotation, while branch `b` does not modify this method.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a's changes**:
     - Adding `@Override` is appropriate if the method is overriding a method from a superclass or interface.
     - Changing the return type to `WebSocket` suggests that the method now returns a WebSocket instance, which may be necessary for further usage or chaining.
   - **Branch b's changes**:
     - The `setupSsl` method is a new utility method that enhances the class by allowing SSL configuration. It is orthogonal to the `start()` method and does not conflict with it.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely intends to make the `start()` method return a WebSocket instance, possibly to allow method chaining or to provide the created WebSocket object for further use.
   - **Branch b** introduces a new method to configure SSL, which is a separate concern from the `start()` method. It does not interfere with the `start()` method's functionality.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in branch `a` are essential for the `start()` method's functionality and should be retained.
   - The changes in branch `b` are additive and do not conflict with the changes in branch `a`. The `setupSsl` method can coexist with the updated `start()` method.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both the updated `start()` method from branch `a` and the new `setupSsl` method from branch `b`.

```java
@Override
public WebSocket start() {
    // Implementation of start method
}

public WebSocketClient setupSsl(InputStream keyStore, String pass) {
    sslFactory = new SslFactory(keyStore, pass);
    return this;
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public WebSocketClient setupSsl(InputStream keyStore, String pass) {
        sslFactory = new SslFactory(keyStore, pass);
        return this;
    }

    @Override
    public WebSocketClient start() {
