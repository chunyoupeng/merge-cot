### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence


## From base to b
<ADD> / *
<DELETE> if ( albumsMode ) <newline> if ( getAlbums ( ) . getSelectedCount ( ) = = albumsAdapter . getItemCount ( ) ) { <newline> editMode = false ; <newline> getAlbums ( ) . clearSelectedAlbums ( ) ; <newline> } else getAlbums ( ) . selectAllAlbums ( ) ; <newline> albumsAdapter . notifyDataSetChanged ( ) ; <newline> } else {


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict occurs in the `case R.id.select_all` block.
   - **Branch `a`** has made no changes compared to the base. The code remains the same.
   - **Branch `b`** has completely removed the content of the `else` block and replaced it with a comment (`/* ... */`), effectively commenting out the entire logic for the `select_all` case when `albumsMode` is false.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** keeps the original logic intact. It handles the `select_all` case for both `albumsMode` and the default case.
   - **Branch `b`** removes the logic for the `select_all` case when `albumsMode` is false. This could be intentional (e.g., to disable this functionality), but it's unclear from the context. However, commenting out the code suggests it might be a placeholder or a temporary change.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to preserve the original behavior of toggling the selection state when `select_all` is clicked.
   - **Branch `b`** may be trying to disable the `select_all` functionality when `albumsMode` is false, or it could be a placeholder for future implementation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since branch `a` preserves the original behavior and branch `b` removes it without clear justification, the correct resolution is to keep the logic from branch `a`.
   - If the intention of branch `b` was to disable the `select_all` functionality in the default case, it should be explicitly implemented rather than commented out.

```java
case R.id.select_all:
                if (albumsMode) {
                    if (getAlbums().getSelectedCount() == albumsAdapter.getItemCount()) {
                        editMode = false;
                        getAlbums().clearSelectedAlbums();
                    } else getAlbums().selectAllAlbums();
                    albumsAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
                } else {
                    if (getAlbums().getSelectedCount() == albumsAdapter.getItemCount()) {
                        editMode = false;
                        getAlbums().clearSelectedAlbums();
                    } else getAlbums().selectAllAlbums();
                    albumsAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
                }
