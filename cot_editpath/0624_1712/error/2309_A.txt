### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
errorNotification("Sync not configured");
||||||| base
displayErrorNotification("Sync not configured");
=======
displayErrorNotification(context
					.getString(R.string.sync_not_configured));
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> displayErrorNotification <WITH> errorNotification)


## From base to b
<REPLACE> " <WITH> context)
<REPLACE> Sync <WITH> <newline>)
<REPLACE> not <WITH> .)
<REPLACE> configured <WITH> getString)
<REPLACE> " <WITH> ()
<ADD> R . string . sync_not_configured )


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In `base`, the line is: `displayErrorNotification("Sync not configured");`
   - In `a`, it is changed to: `errorNotification("Sync not configured");`
     - This replaces `displayErrorNotification` with `errorNotification`, likely a shorthand or renamed function.
   - In `b`, it is changed to: `displayErrorNotification(context.getString(R.string.sync_not_configured));`
     - This replaces the hardcoded string with a localized string resource, using `context.getString(...)`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Change in `a`:** The function name is changed from `displayErrorNotification` to `errorNotification`. This could be due to a refactoring or renaming of the function. However, it's unclear if `errorNotification` is a valid function in the current context. If it's a typo or a renamed function, it should be corrected or verified.
   - **Change in `b`:** The hardcoded string is replaced with a localized string using `context.getString(...)`. This is a best practice for internationalization and should be preserved.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Intention in `a`:** Likely to refactor or rename the function `displayErrorNotification` to `errorNotification`. However, without more context, it's unclear if this is a valid or intended change.
   - **Intention in `b`:** To improve the code by using a localized string instead of a hardcoded one, which is a good practice for maintainability and internationalization.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The change in `b` is more robust and aligns with best practices (internationalization).
   - The change in `a` is questionable unless `errorNotification` is a valid function. If it's a typo or incorrect function name, it should be corrected.
   - Therefore, the correct resolution is to keep the logic from `b` and discard the change from `a` unless `errorNotification` is a valid function.
