### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
public interface Session extends lotus.domino.Session, org.openntf.domino.ext.Session, Base<lotus.domino.Session> {
||||||| base
public interface Session extends lotus.domino.Session, Base<lotus.domino.Session> {
=======
public interface Session extends lotus.domino.Session, Base<lotus.domino.Session> {

	/**
	 * The Enum RunContext.
	 */
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> . Session , org . openntf . domino . ext


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> <newline> / * * <newline> * The Enum RunContext . <newline> * /


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added `org.openntf.domino.ext.Session` to the list of interfaces that the `Session` interface extends.
   - **Branch `b`** added a new Java-style comment block (a Javadoc-style comment) describing an enum `RunContext` as a new method-level or class-level documentation.

   The conflict occurs because both branches made changes to the same interface declaration block, but in different parts:
   - `a` modified the interface declaration line.
   - `b` added a new comment block inside the interface body.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is structural and adds a new interface to the inheritance chain. This is likely a functional enhancement or a dependency requirement.
   - **Branch `b`'s change** is a documentation addition. It introduces a Javadoc comment that describes an enum `RunContext`, which may be a placeholder or a future addition to the interface.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** likely intends to extend the `Session` interface with additional functionality from `org.openntf.domino.ext.Session`.
   - **Branch `b`** likely intends to document an upcoming or existing enum `RunContext` that may be used in the interface or its implementation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are valid and non-conflicting in terms of code structure. The addition of the interface in `a` is a structural change, and the comment in `b` is a documentation addition.
   - The correct resolution is to **combine both changes**:
     - Include the new interface from `a`.
     - Include the Javadoc comment from `b`.
   - The Javadoc comment should be placed inside the interface body, and the interface declaration should include the new interface from `a`.
