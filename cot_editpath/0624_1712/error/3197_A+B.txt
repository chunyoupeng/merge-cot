### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
void validateNoDuplicateInputs(List<Input> inputs, Input element);
    void validateNoDuplicateStepInputs(List<Argument> inputs, Argument element);
    void validateNoDuplicateOutputs(List<Output> outputs, Output element);
    void validateNoDuplicateResults(List<Result> results, Result element);
||||||| base

void validateResultsSection(Map<String, Object> executableRawData, String artifact, List<RuntimeException> errors);
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


## From base to b
The entire content comes from it, as the base is empty.


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - The conflict is between two sets of method declarations:
     - **Branch a** added four methods:
       - `void validateNoDuplicateInputs(List<Input> inputs, Input element);`
       - `void validateNoDuplicateStepInputs(List<Argument> inputs, Argument element);`
       - `void validateNoDuplicateOutputs(List<Output> outputs, Output element);`
       - `void validateNoDuplicateResults(List<Result> results, Result element);`
     - **Branch b** added one method:
       - `void validateResultsSection(Map<String, Object> executableRawData, String artifact, List<RuntimeException> errors);`

   - The base is empty, so both branches are adding entirely new methods.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** is focused on validation logic to ensure no duplicates in various data structures (`Inputs`, `StepInputs`, `Outputs`, `Results`). These methods likely serve as helper functions for validation logic in a system that manages inputs and outputs.
   - **Branch b** is focused on a broader validation method that validates an entire "results section" using raw data and an artifact, collecting errors in a list. This method seems to be a higher-level validation function.

   - Both sets of methods are valid and serve different purposes. There is no direct overlap or conflict in functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** aims to provide granular validation for individual data types to prevent duplicates.
   - **Branch b** aims to provide a more comprehensive validation of the results section, likely for integration or system-level validation.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both sets of methods are distinct and serve different purposes, the best resolution is to **combine both sets of methods** into a single interface or class.
   - This maintains the granular validation logic from `a` and the higher-level validation logic from `b`, ensuring both are available for use.
   - No changes are needed to the method signatures, as they are not conflicting.

```java
void validateNoDuplicateInputs(List<Input> inputs, Input element);
void validateNoDuplicateStepInputs(List<Argument> inputs, Argument element);
void validateNoDuplicateOutputs(List<Output> outputs, Output element);
void validateNoDuplicateResults(List<Result> results, Result element);
void validateResultsSection(Map<String, Object> executableRawData, String artifact, List<RuntimeException> errors);
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
void validateResultsSection(Map<String, Object> executableRawData, String artifact, List<RuntimeException> errors);
    
    void validateNoDuplicateInputs(List<Input> inputs, Input element);
    void validateNoDuplicateStepInputs(List<Argument> inputs, Argument element);
    void validateNoDuplicateOutputs(List<Output> outputs, Output element);
    void validateNoDuplicateResults(List<Result> results, Result element);
