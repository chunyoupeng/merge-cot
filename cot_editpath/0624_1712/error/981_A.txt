### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>asistant

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the line `private final static int DEFAULT_MAPPER_FEATURES = collectFeatureDefaults(MapperFeature.class);` with a block of comment lines and removed the actual assignment.
     - The line was effectively commented out and replaced with a decorative comment block.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Changed the type from `int` to `long`.
     - Replaced `collectFeatureDefaults(MapperFeature.class)` with `MapperFeature.collectLongDefaults()`.
     - This suggests a refactoring to use a new method that returns a `long` instead of an `int`.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The change in `a` appears to be a comment-only modification. It removed the functional code and replaced it with a decorative comment block. This is likely a mistake or a misapplication of a comment block.
     - This change should be **discarded** because it breaks the functionality.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The change in `b` is a meaningful refactoring. It updates the type and method to reflect a new API that returns a `long` instead of an `int`.
     - This change should be **kept** as it reflects a logical and functional improvement.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention seems to be to add a comment block for documentation or separation of code sections. However, the implementation mistakenly removed the actual code.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to update the code to use a new method that returns a `long`, likely to support more features or to align with a new API design.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The correct resolution is to **keep the change from branch `b`** and **discard the change from branch `a`**.
   - The final code should reflect the updated method and type from `b`, as it maintains functionality and aligns with the new API.
