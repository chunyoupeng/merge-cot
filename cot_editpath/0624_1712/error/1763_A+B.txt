### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> SAbstractObject <WITH> Object)
<DELETE> <newline>
<REPLACE> SAbstractObject <WITH> Object)
<REPLACE> SAbstractObject <WITH> Object)


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> final int numUpvalues , final SObject nilObject , numUpvalues , nilObject


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch a** changed the parameter types from `SAbstractObject` to `Object` for `self`, `arg1`, and `arg2`. It also removed the two additional parameters `numUpvalues` and `nilObject` from the constructor.
   - **Branch b** added two new parameters: `numUpvalues` and `nilObject`, and passed them to the `super` call.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch a** likely made the constructor more general by using `Object` instead of a specific type. This could be for flexibility or to support a broader range of inputs.
   - **Branch b** added functionality by introducing `numUpvalues` and `nilObject`, which might be necessary for handling upvalues or nil objects in the context of the class.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch a** seems to be simplifying the constructor by removing parameters and using a more generic type.
   - **Branch b** is extending the constructor to support additional functionality, possibly for a more complex use case.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The best resolution is to combine both changes. The constructor should accept `Object` instead of `SAbstractObject` for the first three parameters (as in branch a), and also include the additional parameters `numUpvalues` and `nilObject` (as in branch b).
   - This way, the constructor is both more flexible (using `Object`) and supports the additional functionality (with `numUpvalues` and `nilObject`).

```java
public TernaryArguments(final Object self, final Object arg1,
        final Object arg2, final int numUpvalues, final SObject nilObject) {
      super(self, numUpvalues, nilObject);
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public TernaryArguments(final Object self, final Object arg1,
        final Object arg2, final int numUpvalues, final SObject nilObject) {
      super(self, numUpvalues, nilObject);
