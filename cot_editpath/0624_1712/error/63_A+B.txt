### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> TransactionSummary <WITH> GenericTransaction)
<REPLACE> getTransactionHistory <WITH> getTransactions)


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> if ( account . equals ( _mbwManager . getSelectedAccount ( ) ) ) { <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** changed:
     - Replaced `TransactionSummary` with `GenericTransaction`.
     - Replaced `getTransactionHistory` with `getTransactions`.
   - **Branch `b`** added:
     - A conditional check `if (account.equals(_mbwManager.getSelectedAccount()))` before the synchronized block.
   - The conflict occurs in the line where `preloadedData` is assigned and the block where `toAdd.addAll(preloadedData)` is executed.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes:**
     - The replacement of `TransactionSummary` with `GenericTransaction` suggests that the branch is using a more generic or different type of transaction object.
     - The method `getTransactions` likely returns a list of `GenericTransaction` objects, which is a more general or different representation than `TransactionSummary`.
     - This change might be part of a broader refactoring or abstraction of the transaction model.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes:**
     - The conditional check ensures that the synchronization and data addition only occur if the account is the selected one.
     - This change likely aims to optimize performance or avoid unnecessary synchronization for non-selected accounts.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** is likely modernizing or abstracting the transaction model by using a more generic type (`GenericTransaction`) and a more general method (`getTransactions`).
   - **Branch `b`** is likely optimizing the code by avoiding unnecessary synchronization and data addition for non-selected accounts.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes.
   - The conditional check from `b` should be preserved to ensure the optimization is in place.
   - The type and method changes from `a` should also be preserved to reflect the updated transaction model.
   - The conflict can be resolved by combining both changes: applying the conditional check from `b` to the updated code from `a`.

# Final resolution
```java
List<GenericTransaction> preloadedData = account.getTransactions(offset, limit);
         if (account.equals(_mbwManager.getSelectedAccount())) {
            synchronized (toAdd) {
               toAdd.addAll(preloadedData);
               success.set(toAdd.size() == limit);
            }
         }
```

List<GenericTransaction> preloadedData = account.getTransactions(offset, limit);
         if(account.equals(_mbwManager.getSelectedAccount())) {
            synchronized (toAdd) {
               toAdd.addAll(preloadedData);
               success.set(toAdd.size() == limit);
            }
