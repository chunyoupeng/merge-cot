### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

## From base to b

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`** added a significant block of code that introduces additional logic for handling `LIKE` pattern arguments. This logic checks if the `LIKE` expression is parameterized or constant and whether it is a prefix pattern. If not, it invalidates the binding and skips the filter. This is a substantial enhancement to the filtering logic.
   - **Branch `b`** added a single line: `originalFilter = filter;` before removing the filter from `filtersToCover`. This line likely stores the original filter before it is removed, possibly for later reference or logging.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change** is a complex logic addition
