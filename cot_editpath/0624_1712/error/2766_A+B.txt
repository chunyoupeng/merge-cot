### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

public void onOpen(ServerSentEvent sse, Response response) {
            Log.v(TAG, "SSEHandler.onOpen: mEventSource=" + (mEventSource == null ? "null" : mEventSource.hashCode()) + ", sse=" + sse.hashCode());

public void onOpen(@NotNull EventSource eventSource, @NotNull Response response) {

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> <newline> Log . v ( TAG , " SSEHandler . onOpen : mEventSource = " + ( mEventSource = = null ? " null " : mEventSource . hashCode ( ) ) + " , sse = " + sse . hashCode ( ) ) ;


## From base to b
<REPLACE> ServerSentEvent <WITH> @)
<REPLACE> sse <WITH> NotNull)
<ADD> EventSource eventSource @ NotNull <newline> failureCount = 0 ;


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Changed the method signature to `public void onOpen(ServerSentEvent sse, Response response)`.
     - Added a logging statement to print the `TAG`, `mEventSource`, and `sse` hash codes.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Changed the method signature to `public void onOpen(@NotNull EventSource eventSource, @NotNull Response response)`.
     - Introduced `@NotNull` annotations for both parameters.
     - Added a line `failureCount = 0;` at the start of the method.

   The conflict arises because both branches modified the method signature and added new content, but in incompatible ways.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s logging statement**:
     - This is useful for debugging and monitoring the state of the method when it is called.
     - It provides visibility into the `sse` and `mEventSource` objects.
   - **Branch `b`'s `@NotNull` annotations**:
     - These are important for ensuring that the method is called with non-null parameters, improving code safety and clarity.
   - **Branch `b`'s `failureCount = 0;`**:
     - This likely resets a counter at the beginning of the connection, which is a logical and useful addition.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aimed to improve logging and visibility into the method's execution.
   - **Branch `b`** aimed to improve type safety and add a logical initialization step.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The method signature from **branch `b`** should be used because it includes `@NotNull` annotations, which are important for code safety.
   - The logging statement from **branch `a`** should be retained, as it adds valuable debugging information.
   - The `failureCount = 0;` line from **branch `b`** should also be retained, as it is a logical initialization step.
   - The `sse` parameter should be replaced with `eventSource` to match the updated method signature.

```java
public void onOpen(@NotNull EventSource eventSource, @NotNull Response response) {
    failureCount = 0;
    Log.v(TAG, "SSEHandler.onOpen: mEventSource=" + (mEventSource == null ? "null" : mEventSource.hashCode()) + ", eventSource=" + eventSource.hashCode());
}
```

### Gold (Ground Truth)
public void onOpen(@NotNull EventSource eventSource, @NotNull Response response) {
            failureCount = 0;
            Log.v(TAG, "SSEHandler.onOpen: mEventSource=" + (mEventSource == null ? "null" : mEventSource.hashCode()));
