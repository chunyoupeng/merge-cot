### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Replaced the hardcoded currency codes (`"BTC"`, `"mBTC"`, `"µBTC"`) with dynamic values using `CoinDefinition.coinTicker`.
     - This suggests an intention to make the code more flexible and maintainable by decoupling the currency ticker from the string literals.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Completely removed the currency code definitions and instead added new constants related to donation addresses and report emails.
     - This suggests an intention to add new features related to reporting and donations, possibly for user feedback or support.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s changes**:
     - The dynamic use of `CoinDefinition.coinTicker` is a good practice for maintainability and extensibility.
     - It avoids hardcoding values and allows the code to adapt to different coin definitions.
   - **Branch `b`'s changes**:
     - The addition of donation address and report email constants is a valid and useful feature.
     - However, it completely removes the original currency code definitions, which is a destructive change and not compatible with `a`'s modifications.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`** aims to improve code flexibility and reduce duplication by using a shared coin ticker.
   - **Branch `b`** aims to add new functionality for user interaction and reporting, but in a way that discards the original purpose of the code block.

4. **Final decision:**
   - The changes in `a` should be preserved because they improve the code's maintainability and align with good software design principles.
   - The changes in `b` should be integrated as new additions rather than replacements, since they introduce new features that do not conflict with the currency code logic.
   - Therefore, the resolution should retain the dynamic currency code definitions from `a` and add the new constants from `b` below them.
