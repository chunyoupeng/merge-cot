### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<REPLACE> getConnectorMap <WITH> getConnectorMapExample)


## From base to b
<ADD> private Map < String , ConfigurationProperty > getConfigurationMapExample ( ) { <newline> Map < String , ConfigurationProperty > configurationMap = new HashMap < > ( ) ; <newline> configurationMap . put ( " exampleKey1 " , new ConfigurationProperty ( " exampleValue1 " , " Example comment 1 " ) ) ; <newline> configurationMap . put ( " exampleKey2 " , new ConfigurationProperty ( " exampleValue2 " , " Example comment 2 " ) ) ; <newline> return configurationMap ; <newline> } <newline> <newline>


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>

1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, there is a method `getConnectorMap(boolean includeNull)` that returns a `Map<String, List<Integer>>`.
   - In branch `a`, the method `getConnectorMap` is renamed to `getConnectorMapExample`, but the return type and functionality remain the same.
   - In branch `b`, a new method `getConfigurationMapExample` is added that returns a `Map<String, ConfigurationProperty>`. This method is unrelated to the `getConnectorMap` method in the base.

   The conflict occurs because both branches have modified the same region of the file, but in different ways:
   - `a` modifies the name of the existing method.
   - `b` adds a new method.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - The change in `a` is a renaming of the method to `getConnectorMapExample`. This is likely for the purpose of adding an example or test method, or to distinguish it from a production method.
   - The change in `b` introduces a new method `getConfigurationMapExample` that is unrelated to the `getConnectorMap` method. This method appears to be an example or test method for a different kind of map.

   Both changes seem to be adding or renaming example/test methods. However, the two methods are unrelated in terms of functionality and return types.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - The intention in `a` is to rename the method to indicate it is an example or test method.
   - The intention in `b` is to add a new example/test method for a different purpose.

   Both changes are likely intended to provide examples or test data for different parts of the system.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since the two changes are unrelated and do not conflict in terms of functionality, the best resolution is to keep both changes.
   - The method `getConnectorMapExample` from `a` should be retained.
   - The new method `getConfigurationMapExample` from `b` should also be retained.
   - The only conflict is in the region where the method is defined, so we need to ensure both methods are included in the final code.

```java

    Map<String, ConfigurationProperty> configurationMap = new HashMap<>();
    configurationMap.put("exampleKey1", new ConfigurationProperty("exampleValue1", "Example comment 1"));
    configurationMap.put("exampleKey2", new ConfigurationProperty("exampleValue2", "Example comment 2"));
    return configurationMap;
}

private Map<String, List<Integer>> getConnectorMapExample(boolean includeNull) {
    Map<String, List<Integer>> connectorMap = new HashMap<>();
    // Example implementation
    return connectorMap;
