### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> ElasticsearchVersion elasticsearchVersion elasticsearchVersion


## From base to b
<ADD> <newline> try { <newline> if ( ! StringUtils . isBlank ( nodes ) ) { <newline> uriSuffix + = URLEncoder . encode ( nodes , CHARSET ) ; <newline> } <newline> } catch ( UnsupportedEncodingException e ) { <newline> log . error ( " Error occurred while adding nodes to uri " , e ) ; <newline> }


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

# <cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - Changed the method signature from `buildURI()` to `buildURI(ElasticsearchVersion elasticsearchVersion)`.
     - This implies that `a` is introducing a new parameter to the method, likely to allow the method to use the `elasticsearchVersion` in its logic.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - Added a `try-catch` block that appends `nodes` to `uriSuffix` if `nodes` is not blank.
     - This logic is about modifying the URI based on the presence of `nodes`, with error handling for encoding issues.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - **Branch `a`'s change**:
     - Introducing a parameter is a significant change that alters the method's contract.
     - It suggests that the method now depends on `elasticsearchVersion` for building the URI, which could affect how the URI is constructed.
     - This change is likely to be kept if the intention is to make the method version-aware.
   - **Branch `b`'s change**:
     - The added logic is about enhancing the URI with `nodes` information, which is a functional enhancement.
     - The `try-catch` block is a good practice for handling potential encoding errors gracefully.
     - This change is also likely to be kept, as it adds robustness and functionality.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - **Branch `a`**:
     - The intention is to make the `buildURI` method version-aware by passing `elasticsearchVersion` as a parameter.
     - This could be to support different versions of Elasticsearch having different URI structures.
   - **Branch `b`**:
     - The intention is to enhance the URI by including `nodes` information if available.
     - This is a feature addition that improves the flexibility of the method.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Both changes are meaningful and serve different purposes.
   - The method signature change in `a` is necessary if the method is to be version-aware.
   - The logic in `b` is a valid enhancement that should be integrated into the new method signature.
   - Therefore, the resolution should include both changes: the new method signature from `a` and the logic from `b`.

# Final Resolution
```java
protected String buildURI(ElasticsearchVersion elasticsearchVersion) {
    String uriSuffix = super.buildURI(elasticsearchVersion);
    try {
        if (!StringUtils.isBlank(nodes)) {
            uriSuffix += URLEncoder.encode(nodes, CHARSET);
        }
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
        log.error("Error occurred while adding nodes to uri", e);
    }
}
```
