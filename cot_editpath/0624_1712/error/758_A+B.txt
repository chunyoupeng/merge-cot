### Prompt
<|im_start|>system
You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
# Conflict
>>>>>>> a
AssetDefinitionService assetDefinitionService,
            OpenseaService openseaService) {
||||||| base
AssetDefinitionService assetDefinitionService) {
=======
AssetDefinitionService assetDefinitionService,
            TokensService tokensService) {
<<<<<<< b

Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Sequence

## From base to a
<ADD> , <newline> OpenseaService openseaService


## From base to b
<ADD> , <newline> TokensService tokensService


# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```\/no_think<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction
<think>

</think>

<cot>
1. **Analyze the conflict point(s):**
   - In the base code, the method constructor only includes `AssetDefinitionService assetDefinitionService`.
   - In branch `a`, an additional parameter `OpenseaService openseaService` is added on a new line.
   - In branch `b`, an additional parameter `TokensService tokensService` is added on a new line.
   - The conflict arises because both branches added a new service parameter to the same method signature, and Git cannot automatically merge these two additions.

2. **Evaluate each change:**
   - Both `OpenseaService` and `TokensService` are likely to be valid and necessary for the method's functionality.
   - The changes are additive and do not conflict in terms of code logic or structure.
   - The only conflict is in the placement of the new parameters in the method signature.

3. **Understand the intention behind each change:**
   - Branch `a` likely added `OpenseaService` to integrate with Opensea-related functionality.
   - Branch `b` likely added `TokensService` to handle token-related operations.
   - Both changes are likely independent and complementary.

4. **Final decision:**
   - Since both parameters are valid and do not conflict logically, the correct resolution is to include both `OpenseaService openseaService` and `TokensService tokensService` in the method signature.
   - The order of the parameters can be preserved as in the original branches, or adjusted for consistency with the rest of the codebase if needed.
