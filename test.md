You are a Great Git merge conflict resolver. Merge conflicts occur because both branch a and branch b have modified the same part of the base code in different ways. Your task is to analyze the changes made by a and b relative to base, understand their intentions, and produce a well-reasoned CoT (Chain of Thought) then then answer.<|im_end|>

**Conflict Representation:**
```java
>>>>>>> Branch A
List<IConsoleParser> parsers = new ArrayList<IConsoleParser>();
ManagedBuildManager.collectLanguageSettingsConsoleParsers(cfgDescription, epm, parsers);

buildRunnerHelper.prepareStreams(epm, parsers, console, 
    new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1 * MONITOR_SCALE));
||||||| Base
buildRunnerHelper.prepareStreams(epm, null, console, 
    new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1 * MONITOR_SCALE));
=======
buildRunnerHelper.prepareStreams(epm, null, console, 
    new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, TICKS_STREAM_PROGRESS_MONITOR));
<<<<<<< Branch B
```
Moreover, we also provide you with the edit sequences, which refer to the token-level modifications from base to a and b, respectively.
# Edit Script

### From Base to Branch A
- **ADD:** `List<IConsoleParser> parsers = new ArrayList<IConsoleParser>();`
- **ADD:** `ManagedBuildManager.collectLanguageSettingsConsoleParsers(cfgDescription, epm, parsers);`
- **REPLACE:** `null` **WITH** `parsers`

### From Base to Branch B
- **REPLACE:** `1` **WITH** `TICKS_STREAM_PROGRESS_MONITOR`
- **DELETE:** `* MONITOR_SCALE`

# CoT guide
1. Analyze the conflict point(s): what did `a` change compared to `base`? what did `b` change compared to `base`?
2. Evaluate each change: why should a particular change be kept, discarded, or modified?
3. Understand the intention behind each change in `a` and `b`.
4. Final decision: based on code style, business logic, and correctness, determine the appropriate resolution. 

# Output Format:
You should output two thing: 
1. the CoT, which should be placed within the <cot></cot> tag.
2. Final resolution, the answer should be within the ```java and ```<|im_end|>

### Model Prediction

<cot>

1. **Conflict Analysis:**
   - Branch A introduces console parser functionality by creating a parser list and replacing the null parameter
   - Branch B refactors the progress monitor to use a named constant instead of a calculated value

2. **Change Evaluation:**
   - Branch A's parser addition enhances build functionality (functional improvement)
   - Branch B's constant replacement improves code readability (style improvement)
   - Both changes are orthogonal and non-conflicting in logic

3. **Intent Understanding:**
   - Branch A: Enhance build runner with detailed console parsing capabilities
   - Branch B: Improve code maintainability through better constant naming

4. **Resolution Decision:**
   Both changes should be integrated as they address different aspects of the code

</cot>

**Final Resolution:**
```java
List<IConsoleParser> parsers = new ArrayList<IConsoleParser>();
ManagedBuildManager.collectLanguageSettingsConsoleParsers(cfgDescription, epm, parsers);

buildRunnerHelper.prepareStreams(epm, parsers, console, 
    new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, TICKS_STREAM_PROGRESS_MONITOR));
```
